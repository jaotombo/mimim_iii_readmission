Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for
hypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and
decreased urine output.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male who had been hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 190**] from [**10-11**] through [**10-19**] of [**2101**]
after undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was
subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

On [**2101-10-20**], he presented again to the [**Hospital1 346**] after being found to have a systolic
blood pressure in the 70s and no urine output for 17 hours.
A Foley catheter placed at the rehabilitation facility
yielded 100 cc of murky/brown urine.  There may also have
been purulent discharge at the penile meatus at this time.

On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient was
without subjective complaints.  In the Emergency Department,
he was found to have systolic blood pressure of 85.  He was
given 6 liters of intravenous fluids and transiently started
on dopamine for a systolic blood pressure in the 80.s

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living
at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital
on [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a
social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;
although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following
administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory
was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There
were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft
pulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done
by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was
initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell
count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets
were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR
was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,
potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose
was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and
phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were
pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on
admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out
yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also
initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated
stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no
focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of
the chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,
nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages
in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].

An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination
that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No
evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,
incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple
left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and
partially calcified prostate gland.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased
urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary
to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were
never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).

While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
night of admission, the patient had a sudden
cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with
epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion
times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.

Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus
rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;
the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to
the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He
subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood
pressure.

An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a
trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a
hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided
filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this
arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were
elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.

A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]
demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities
including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular
akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study
of [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was
unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the
right ventricular function appeared worse.

On [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone
and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The
following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given
his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this
medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated
troponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient
was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.

After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made
to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the
patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family
no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.

By [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was
restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.

On the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained
of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and
morphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3
that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.
Therefore, the patient was again started on heparin;
although, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when
the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he
again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

By hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence
of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid
resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.
By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service
on [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly
volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid
resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,
he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that
he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive
heart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of
his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was
greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on
gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already
taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to
admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative
urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous
fluids.

On [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was
discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the
growth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of
gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was
discontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious
Disease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on
[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was
discontinued on [**2101-10-29**].

Despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis
precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any
positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of
yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained
afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his
antibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile
negative on [**2101-10-28**].

3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and
he was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently
developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to
cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed
toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his
he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%
on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium
nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his
respiratory secretions.

4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid
resuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum
creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly
malnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once
he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a
modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin
liquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,
small bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and
aspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with
and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his
heart-healthy/diabetic diet.

6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot
ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was
started on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved
wound healing.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells on [**2101-10-27**] to maintain a
hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe
coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently
remained stable.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (last
CD4 count 42 and a viral load of 65,000), cirrhosis,
diabetes, and hypothyroidism presented with eight days of
fevers to 104, chills, shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on
exertion, and fatigue.

The patient states she has become progressively dyspneic to
the point where she is short of breath with speaking.  She
has also had night sweats for the past two days and whitish
sputum.  She complains of myalgias.  No recent ill contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] known tuberculosis exposure.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially 96% on
room air, with a respiratory rate of 20, and a heart rate of
117.  A chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial opacities.
She received 3 liters of normal saline, clindamycin, and
primaquine for likely Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  She
spiked a temperature to 102.1 and became progressively
dyspneic with her respiratory rate increasing to 40, and her
oxygen saturations dropping to 89% on room air.  She was
placed on 6 liters by nasal cannula, and an arterial blood
gas showed 7.47/28/74.  The patient was given prednisone and
aztreonam for possible cholangitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
patient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,
her respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,
and her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6
liters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She
was unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was
cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was
supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax
revealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were
no murmurs.  The abdomen revealed mild diffuse tenderness to
percussion, hepatomegaly 6 cm below the costal margin, no
spleen palpated, positive bowel sounds.  There was no rebound
or guarding.  Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.
Pulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was [**5-18**] in all
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
a white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%
lymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were
within normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a
creatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,
her alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase
was 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct
bilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was
negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive
for 30 protein.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia; unchanged from [**2187**].

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in
the left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia or viral pneumonia.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.
No gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit secondary
to respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a
respectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with
possible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.

Given her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was
started on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage
with primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on
prednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her
low PAO2.

In the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed
with 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears
were negative.

The patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her
medication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to
saturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on
primaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of
antibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.

2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from
admission from [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] grew out
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ([**4-19**] blood
cultures).  At that time, the patient was started on
vancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood
cultures.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out
endocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;
although, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her
peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent
surveillance blood cultures from [**3-17**] on were negative,
and the patient was to be continued on vancomycin
intravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood
cultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient
remained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.

3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class
cirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in [**2190-10-13**].  Her
cirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active
antiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
in [**2191-4-14**] for a visit.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the
patient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and
was within normal limits.

4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was
restarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen
on hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these
medications without any problems.  She was also continued on
acyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] in clinic over the next two
weeks.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on
original regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary
to her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated
while in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her
Lantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the
morning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with
improved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units
of Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the
next three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which
time her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,
and her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.

6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
Levoxyl.

7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter
line was placed on [**2191-3-19**] for intravenous antibiotics.
It was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was
pulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the
superior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted
central catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her
course of intravenous vancomycin.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for cirrhosis and with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4390**] next
Friday for primary care.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for
transplant surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old
woman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant
hypertension. She was started on dialysis in [**2174-2-7**].  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears
to be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia
which she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on [**2175-5-30**] for
a scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is
the donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)
and will have a final T & B cell class match prior to
transplantation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to
malignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia
following gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for
coronary artery disease for diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a
history of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.
Occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs
were stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight
160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal
dialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good
femoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2175-5-30**], the patient went to the
operating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and assisting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see details
of this surgery in operating room note. Also during her
operating room time, the patient also had a right iliac
artery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the
completion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic
appearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In
the operation, there was some difficulty with arterial
anastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] came to assist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Again, please see
details of that operation in the operative report.

Postoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was
placed on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The
patient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had
2 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good
dorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The
patient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal
was consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the
patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable
renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance
of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and
resistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had another
ultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they
wanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that
there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted
kidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from
yesterday which was on [**2175-5-30**] with a small amount of pelvic
ectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The
patient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.
Her heparin was discontinued on [**2175-6-1**]. The patient received
1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on [**6-1**], Tacrolimus was
started.  On [**2175-6-2**], the patient had some complaint of right
foot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to
rule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence
of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On [**2175-6-2**],
WBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on [**6-2**], PT was 13.5,
PTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,
100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.

Vascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was
decided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be
continued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient
still complained of right foot numbness but it was about the
same and not worse.  She was continued on all of her
immunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,
Cellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned
from heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the
floor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient
had another ultrasound on [**2175-6-6**] because there was blood in
her [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.
Ultrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,
blood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6
by 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to
the contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral
aspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal
blood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to
this area on a follow up scan is recommended to document
interval change or resolution.

On [**2175-6-9**], the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.
The patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting
edema of right lower extremity greater than left lower
extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the
right iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous
thrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial
femoral veins which had developed since [**2175-6-2**]. There
is a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient
continued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was
eventually removed, continued on [**2175-6-12**] with drain output of
170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with
services on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.
day, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin
5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a
day, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,
Lopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg
q. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2
and 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at
bedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium
phosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours
prn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for an appointment.  The
patient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day
located on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and
her skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the
first 6 weeks after surgery.

DIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal
transplant.
Arterial thrombosis.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Resolving hypertension.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 50 year old female presents after having fallen in the
bathtub 4 days ago and hitting the back of her head. Since then
she has had a ""massive headache"" which did not resolve with
Tylenol. She states that she has a high threshold for pain and
did not realize how bad it was during the day while at work but
then when she got home at night she noticed it. The patient
noticed ""silvery spects"" in her vision and she had trouble with
some simple tasks like finding the tags on the back of her
clothing in the morning. She reported that she had to check
several times to make sure she did not put her clothes on
backwards. She has had some dizziness, but no nausea or
vomiting.
Her speech has not been affected.

HISTORY: Brain mass. Now has headache. Evaluate for any changes.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.

COMPARISON STUDY: [**2178-4-17**] CT scan of the head, reported
by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 21881**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing ""unchanged mass
effect and edema around large right parietal mass, without
evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage following biopsy.""

FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there is now mild linear
hyperdensity within the basal cisterns of this could be
hemorrhage, occasionally the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
can be somewhat denser appearing, in the setting of increased
intracranial pressure, which would mimic the presence of
subarachnoid blood.

No other new intracranial or extracranial abnormalities are
discerned.

CONCLUSION: Possible small amount of subarachnoid blood or
relatively stagnant vascular flow, in the face of increased
intracranial pressure, as noted above. We have telephoned (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] with this report immediately after the conclusion of the
study.

ADDENDUM: There is a tiny residual gas collection superior to
the biopsy site, definitely decreased in extent compared to the
prior study of [**4-17**].

EMERGENCY MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN.

HISTORY: Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted brain images with
gadolinium enhancement.

COMPARISON STUDIES: None available at this time.

WET READ REPORT: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] interpreted this study as
revealing ""bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic
disease. The largest mass in the right parietal lobe has a
complex appearance, at least 5 cm in greatest dimension with at
least 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema and 7 mm
leftward midline shift."" Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] is a member of the
""Nighthawk"" Radiology group.

FINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal,
irregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny
""daughter"" cystic components extending towards the cortical
surface. As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 1131**], there is a substantial
area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right atrium
and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation. A smaller
area of edema is seen within the white matter of the left
occipital lobe, but I cannot delineate any specific area of
enhancement associated with it. A third, very well circumscribed
18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen contiguous to the
left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether the
lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale. Again, there is no
associated enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted,
either. On the coronal post-contrast images, there is a
questionable area of enhancement, approximately 3 mm,
immediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am not
certain that the two findings are necessarily related. The
principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is no
overt extracranial abnormality noted.

CONCLUSION: Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent
either a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm. The additional
abnormalities within the left temporal lobe and left occipital
lobe, while they may represent extremely unusual manifestations
of metastatic disease, which would then render the right
parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have
alternative diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left
temporal meningioma as an explanation for the left temporal
lesion, and either an inflammatory or ischemic process to
account for the left occipital lesion. I discussed this case
this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast
head CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to
further characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior
to brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.

*******

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 year-old woman without significant PMH who presented
[**2178-4-16**] from OSH with new dx of brain mass after fall, with
biopsy that showed GBM, for which she had craniectomy/debulking
[**2178-4-23**] and was started on XRT without event.
.
1) Glioblastoma Multiforme: She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after
fall and was noted to have a brain mass. She had a biopsy which
showed glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. She was noted on [**4-21**] to have
headache, with 4/18 she had mental status changes and imaging
c/w herniation. She was taken emergently to the OR [**4-23**] for
craniotomy and subtotal tumor debulking. She was then
transferred to Omed for XRT and chemotherapy. She was maintained
on keppra and decadron for seizure/cerebral edema prevention.
She was maintained on seizure precautions with frequent neuro
checks. She used a helmet with ambulation given s/p craniectomy.
She was started on XRT with temador. She remained stable without
signs of elevated intracranial pressure during this so was
thought stable to go home and continue XRT as an outpatient. She
was seen by PT and though stable to go home. She was continued
on pantoprazole and sliding scale insulin while on
dexamethasone.

Date of Birth:   [**2127-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a
one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the
past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous
exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually
resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with
walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated
nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she
started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.
She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,
where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which
revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to
her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and
back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip
was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of
IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the
cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now
she is not actively complaining of any pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity
edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have
dysmenorrhea.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,
diagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet
since [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has
lost 40 pounds in the last six months.

SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,
lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg
once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,
Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol
and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.
Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial
infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She
does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,
in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse
72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.
Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes
moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but
she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities
are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all
extremities.

Her laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were
white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.
Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total
cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at
[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior
descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;
50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;
moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection
fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right
coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than
what was actually reported on the initial catheterization
results from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be
80% as previously reported.

So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable
angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an
intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,
and was ""preoped"" and consented for a CABG on the next day
because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.
after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the
operating room.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,
three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to
the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous
vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on
cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross
clamped for 53 of those minutes.

She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the
intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.

Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her
intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips
were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative
day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she
was transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues
were as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared
her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with
mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively
diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted
accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia
while she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation
was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a
day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an
outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup
appointment.

On [**1-14**] the patient's central line was discontinued.
She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;
however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to
be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and
an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this
chest pain.

She is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,
being discharged home in good condition with home physical
therapy scheduled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Unstable angina.
6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic
balloon pump.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.;  follow your blood sugar
levels and follow up with [**Doctor First Name 8392**].
8.  Percocet one to two tablets every four hours as needed
for pain.
9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed for constipation.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54220**]owup appointments are with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] one to two weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], her
cardiologist, in two to three weeks, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from [**Doctor First Name 8392**]
as directed, and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in one month. She is also
recommended to follow up in [**Hospital1 18**] Wound Care Clinic in one to
two weeks to remove her staples.

If the previously right coronary artery stenosis is a cause
for concern or patient morbidity in the future, this lesion
can certainly be addressed percutaneously with balloon
angiography. She will be followed very closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 677**]
as an outpatient, and if this lesion does cause her problems,
this may be addressed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11679**] was admitted and underwent surgical closure of her
patent foramen ovale. The operation was performed minimally
invasive and there were no complications. Following the
procedure, she was brought to the CSRU. She initially remained
hypotensive, requiring volume and Neosynephrine. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. By postoperative day two, she successfully weaned
from inotropic support. She maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the floor. On telemetry, she remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm with brief periods of accelerated junctional
rhythm. She otherwise continued to make clinical improvements
and was cleared for discharge on postoperative day four. She
remained just on Aspirin therapy. Aggrenox was not resumed as
her PFO was surgically repaired. At discharge, her systolic
blood pressures were in the 100's with heart rate of 80-90. Her
room air saturations were 93% and she was ambulating without
difficulty. She had good pain control with Dilaudid and all
wounds were clean, dry and intact.

EEG
This is a normal EEG in the awake and drowsy states. Note
is incidentally made of a resting tachycardia.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50M with history of hypertension, type II diabetes,
originally admitted to psychiatry for [**Month/Day/Year **], made NPO p MN for [**Month/Day/Year **]
in AM with 1/2 dose of insulin, who was found unresponsive and
in apparent seizure state, who was found to have a blood glucose
of 30.
.
1)Convulsions:
A code was called and the patient was given Ativan 2mg po x1, as
well as an amp of D50, loaded with Dilantin and transferred to
the MICU.  The seizure was attributed to his hypoglycemic state,
although psych thought there was an element of Klonopin
withdrawal and thus continued to give Ativan 0.5mg po q4.  Pt
had frequent BS checks in the MICU and patient recovered from
his initial event without any post-seizure sequelae.  Pt
continued to be monitored and had no further events.  Neurology
was consulted for his ? seizure event and after a negative exam
and negative EEG, concluded that it was all due to hypoglycemia,
and that further Dilantin would not be necessary.
Dilantin was d/ced and patient continued to do well.  He was
eventually transferred to the floor.   All home medications were
continued and patient continued to express interest in his [**Month/Day/Year **]
treatment on Monday, although refused to be transferred back to
[**Hospital1 **] 4.
All home medications although his insulin dose (nph 20 qPM) was
halved (--> NPH 10 qPM) on the floor, and his sugars were
running in the 150s-250s range.
Pt was sent home to return for [**Hospital1 **] on Monday as an outpatient.
Explicit instructions were given to take all medications as
normal the night before, including his Klonopin, and only take
[**1-13**] dose of NPH insulin the night before, NPO p MN, no morning
NPH dose, and to cover his elevated morning sugars with Humalog
at a conservative sliding scale.  Goal sugars 150s-250s.

2) Type 2 DM - follow sugars closely
- Continue normal dose insulin while taking POs, and when NPO p
MN for [**Month/Day (4) **] in AM, pt was instructed to take [**1-13**] NPH dose the
evening before, no NPH in the AM, and to cover with Humalog prn
according to conservative insulin SS to prevent hypoglycemic
episodes.
.
3) Depression:
Pt with a h/o refractory depression that was originally admitted
to the psych service for [**Month/Day (4) **].  Psych consult remained aware as
pt was admitted to the MICU and then called out to the floors.
Recommended continuing his Klonopin 3mg po bid for his anxiety,
and added Ativan 0.5mg po q4 for coverage of his anxiety and
alleviation of ? withdrawal during periods when he is off the
Klonopin.  Continued his home doses of Celexa, Nortriptyline,
Seroquel and trazodone for sleep.
Pt was to be discharged to return on Monday for [**Month/Day (4) **] treatments
as an outpatient.
.
4) F/E/N:

Reason: r/o vascular injury (CTA neck only)
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **]yo M s/p fall with dens fx, change in MS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o vascular injury (CTA neck only)
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post fall with dens fracture, change in
mental status. Rule out vascular injury. CTA neck only.

TECHNIQUE: CTA neck with multiplanar reconstructions,
three-dimensional reconstructions.

FINDINGS: There is a plaque with ulceration at the origin of the
left internal carotid artery. The residual lumen at site of the
stenosis is approximately 3 mm. There is also an ulcerative
plaque seen in the right internal carotid artery at a similar
level without significant stenosis. The remainder of the
visualized vessels is within normal limits without stenosis,
extravasation or aneurysm formation. Calcified plaques are noted
in the aortic arch. The visualized soft tissue structures appear
unremarkable without pathologic enhancement. The visualized lung
portions are unremarkable without pneumo- or hemothorax. Mucosal
thickening is noted in the sphenoid and bilateral maxillary
sinuses without air fluid levels.

IMPRESSION: Plaque with ulceration at the proximal left internal
carotid artery with a residual lumen of 3 mm. This represents a
50% stenosis. Ulcerated plaque without significant stenosis in
the right proximal internal carotid artery. No active
extravasation.

PRELIMINARY REPORT: No active extravasation. Proximal right ICA
may contain a web as there is very focal narrowing. Proximal
left ICA has an area that may represent an ulcerative plaque or
early dissection. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 18954**] MDMBA

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN, [**2108-8-7**]

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with agitation after a fall and dens
fracture, rule out intracranial hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were
obtained. Comparison is made to an MRI of the brain from
[**8-5**] and a CT scan of the brain from [**2108-8-5**].

FINDINGS:

There is no change in the appearance of the brain, compared to
previous studies. No acute hemorrhage is evident. There are no
abnormal extra-axial collections. There is no intracranial mass
effect or shift of structures. The ventricles are not dilated.
An old right cerebellar infarction and areas of white matter
hypodensity, likely chronic microvascular infarction, are noted
and unchanged.

There is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and frontal sinuses
and a small amount of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus. The
mastoids are aerated.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain, compared to recent
previous studies. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT  [**2108-8-8**] 1:38 PM

KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT

Reason: r/o fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o fx
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man status post fall. Evaluate for
fracture.

THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT KNEE:

There is a fracture of the inferior patella transfixed by a
cerclage wire. The fracture margins appear indistinct and old.

There is a joint effusion, with an equivocal fat-fluid level.
The oblique view demonstrates a vertical linear lucency with
could represent an more acute non- displaced fracture. If the
hardware in the patella was not placed in the past several weeks
or months, then that lucency does indeed represent a new non-
displaced patellar fracture. No other acute fracture is
identified about the knee.

IMPRESSION:

Old patellar fracture transfixed by cerclage wire. Probable new
nondisplaced patellar fracture.

ADDENDUM [**2108-8-10**] - Please note that the original house officer
dictation did not reflect the presence of the joint effusion or
suspected acute fracture. This change in [**Location (un) 1131**] was discussed
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17148**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] on [**2108-8-10**] at 2:45 pm, who confirms that the old
patellar fracture was remote.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Orthopedic Spine was
immediately consulted because of his cervical spine injuries.
Recommended non-surgical intervention with cervical collar for
2-3 months. Neurosurgery consulted for patient's cervical
fracture as well, recommendations for further radiologic imaging
to evaluate for any vertebral artery dissection and monitoring
neurological status. Vascular surgery consulted for likely
dissection of left ICA, recommendations for ASA for
anticoagulation; no Heparin given history falls; and re imaging
if patient develops signs and symptoms. Geriatrics consulted
given patient's mechanism of injury; delirium identified and
recommendations made re: treating his delirium; Olanzapine
started; bone densitometry while in rehab to screen for
osteoporosis and initiating Calcium with Vit D.  Speech and
Swallow consulted for his dysphagia; bedside swallow study
performed. Recommendations for nectar thick liquids and ground
diet. Physical therapy consulted due to patient's decreased
functional mobility and falls; recommendations for rehab stay
after discharge from hospital. Patient sustained a mechanical
fall during his hospitalization; a head CT scan and films of his
left knee were obtained; no intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Knee films revealed questionable non displaced patellar
fracture, Orthopedics was consulted and recommended a knee
immobilizer and and follow up in 3 weeks.

Date of Birth:   [**2107-6-13**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old female
with a 20 year history of hypertension and a ten year history
of Type 2 diabetes who demonstrated a positive exercise
stress test in [**2183-3-1**] suggestive for possible coronary
artery disease.  The patient received a stress test as part
of a risk stratification workup and at no point demonstrated
any evidence of chest pain.  A subsequent exercise MIBI study
performed [**2183-3-28**] revealed an exercise capacity of
only 2 minutes 15 seconds on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  There was
no chest pain noted on the test and the peak exercise
electrocardiogram showed 1.5 to 2 mm horizontal to upsloping
ST depression in the inferior leads and in V1 and V2.
Imaging studies revealed a large apical to a small anterior
defect that was reversible.  The patient's ejection fraction
was noted to be 56% with normal wall motion.  The patient
subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2183-4-22**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease
and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  The patient was
thereafter referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for surgical
evaluation and was subsequently scheduled for a coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2183-4-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2183-4-28**], the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times three with grafts from the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was
left open.  Lines were placed including an arterial line and
a Swan-Ganz catheter ; both atrial and ventricular wires were
placed; tubes placed included in a mediastinal and bilateral
pleural tubes.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further
evaluation and management.  Shortly after arriving in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was easily weaned
and extubated without complication.  On postoperative day #1,
the patient was noted to be stable for transfer to the floor
and was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service
under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  The patient's
postoperative course was uneventful and she progressed well
clinically.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's chest
tube and Foley catheter were successfully removed without
complications.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneumothorax, and the patient was noted to be
independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the
duration of her stay.  Physical therapy performed an initial
evaluation with the patient and followed her progress for the
duration of her stay.  On postoperative day #3, the patient's
pacer wires were removed without complications and her
sternal incision was noted to be clean, dry and intact with
Steri-Strips in place.  The patient was successfully advanced
to a regular diet, which she tolerated well and was noted to
have adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  The
patient steadily advanced in her ability to ambulate freely
and was subsequently cleared for discharge to home by
physical therapy.  The patient was subsequently cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day #4, [**2183-5-3**], with
instructions for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home with instructions for follow up.

COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left
sided
pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg).
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8.

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery
had
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left
anterior
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal
segments.  The
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
The right
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total
occlusion of
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal
RCA
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches.
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with
lesion
reduction from 99 to 0%
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and
stenting
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion
reduction
from 80% to 0%.
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow in
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the
stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any
vessel.
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8)

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis
central
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the
left
common femoral vein.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index.
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1.
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
6. Successful implantation of a central venous dialysis catheter
in the
left femoral vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also
underwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.
4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive
nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V
graft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once
graft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to
access per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and
successful angioplasty was performed.
5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for
suspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently
elevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was
positive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a
repeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient
started on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures
pending at time of discharge, no growth to date.
6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic
renal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee
ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,
and patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above
30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron
supplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in
addition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis
7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent
hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale
with Accu-Check to monitor.
8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100
mg once daily.
Patient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed
on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Patient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up
with cardiology and PCP within the next month.

Date of Birth:   [**2131-5-7**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unresponsiveness

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 64-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, depression, prior
suicide attempt by overdose, recently with exacerbated mood
disorder status post the death of her husband in [**2195-6-2**], now presented after being found unresponsive.  The
patient's daughters found her in the morning of the day of
presentation, unresponsive with empty bottles of Ambien and
Zyprexa at the bedside.  Pill count revealed that the patient
had likely taken 26 Ambien and 12 Zyprexa.  The patient has
been unable to be alone secondary to depression with suicidal
ideation, and has been living with her daughters.  They note
that the patient went to bed at 11 P.M. the night prior to
admission and was found at 11 A.M. unresponsive with
respiratory depression.  The patient had seen her primary
psychiatrist the day before.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was charcoaled,
gastric lavaged, and intubated for airway protection.  She
was hemodynamically stable.  She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was able to open her
eyes, and was moving all four extremities and responsive to
command.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Depression with suicide attempt ten years ago by
overdose.  The patient was hospitalized for two weeks at that
point.  The patient's outpatient psychiatrist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:   Zyprexa 2.5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime,
Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily, Ambien 10 mg by mouth
daily at bedtime, Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily,
nortriptyline 25 mg by mouth daily at bedtime, Klonopin 0.5
to 1 mg daily at bedtime, Biotin and calcium supplementation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with her daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
husband died in [**2196-1-2**].  The patient denied any
tobacco, alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient's temperature was 97.7,
with a blood pressure of 130/65, pulse of 84, respiratory
rate of 14, and oxygen saturation of 100%.  The patient was
ventilated on IMV pressure support with a rate of 14,
pressure support of 10, PEEP of 7.5, volume of 500, and 40%
FIO2.  On general examination, the patient was a very
ill-appearing female, in no apparent distress.  She was
intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed 1 to 2 mm nonreactive pupils.  Neck examination
revealed no jugular venous distention and no bruits.  Cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2, and no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Pulmonary examination
revealed that the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdominal examination revealed a belly that was
soft, nontender, nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema, with 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological examination revealed
a patient that was moving all four extremities, opening eyes
intermittently, withdrawing to pain.  The patient had 2+ deep
tendon reflexes, and downgoing plantar reflexes.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a white blood cell count
of 5.1, hematocrit of 35.9, platelets of 259.  The patient
had a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103,
bicarbonate of 28, BUN of 17, creatinine of 0.6, and glucose
of 102.  The patient's INR was 1.1.  The patient had an ALT
of 19, an AST of 26.  Arterial blood gas was performed
post-intubation and was found to be pH of 7.47, PACO2 of 29,
and PAO2 of 287.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 80, with normal
axis, [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and intervals, and ST elevations in V2 and
Lead I.

Other studies:  Urine toxicology was negative, serum
toxicology was negative.  Urinalysis revealed negative
nitrates, leukocytes, blood, no red blood cells, no white
blood cells, occasional bacteria, and less than one
epithelial cell.

Head CT:  No signs of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 64-year-old female with a
history of hypertension and depression with suicidal ideation
and previous history of overdose attempt, status post likely
overdose on Ambien and Zyprexa, status post intubation and
hemodynamically stable.

1.  Toxicology:  Patient with likely Ambien overdose and
Zyprexa overdose.  Her symptoms of light coma, somnolence and
respiratory compromise were consistent with Ambien overdose.
The patient also had evidence of myosis, which was consistent
with Zyprexa overdose.  The patient had been gastric lavaged,
charcoaled and supported in the Emergency Department.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was supported with
intravenous fluids and gradually weaned on the ventilator to
the point where she was successfully extubated shortly after
arriving to the Intensive Care Unit.

2.  Psychiatric:  Patient with major depression, recently
exacerbated by the loss of her husband, now with a second
overdose attempt in her lifetime.  Likely Zyprexa and Ambien
were the agents responsible.  Multiple attempts were made in
the effort to contact the patient's outpatient psychiatrist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was unable to be reached.  Psychiatry was
consulted, who felt that the patient needed inpatient
evaluation and treatment.  They also recommended
psychotropics be avoided, and that the patient have a
one-to-one sitter.  Social Work and Case Management were
consulted.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Patient was hemodynamically stable with
history of hypertension.  Her antihypertensives were held.
Her electrocardiogram was unremarkable, although there were
no studies for comparison.

4.  Pulmonary:  Patient intubated secondary to decreased
mental status without a primary lung process.
Post-extubation arterial blood gas did not suggest any
obstructive lung process leading to hypercarbia or hypoxemia
from other pulmonary process.  The examination was
unremarkable.  A facile extubation was anticipated, and the
patient was extubated within several hours of arriving in the
Intensive Care Unit.

5.  Psychosocial:  Communication was maintained with the
patient's daughters, who also felt that the patient should
receive inpatient evaluation and treatment.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to an inpatient
psychiatric bed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily,
Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Major depression
2.  Ambien and Zyprexa overdose
3.  Hypertension

[**2153-9-3**] Four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting(LIMA to LAD,
SVG to Diagonal, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with known CAD. He underwent PTCA to
LAD and diagonal in [**2145**]. Prior to hernia repair operation, an
ETT in [**2153-7-27**] was notable for EKG changes. An ECHO in [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2153**] was notable for mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] AS. The [**Location (un) 109**] was
estimated at 1.1 cm2 with peak/mean gradients of 34 and 22 mmHg.
The was mild concentric LVH with an LVEF of 60%. He was
subsequently referred for cardiac catheterization. This was
performed at the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-8-16**]. Angiography showed a right
dominant system with 80% ostial LAD lesion; first diagonal had a
60% stenosis; the circumflex had a 60% lesion while the RCA had
a 40% stenosis. There was only mild AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.8 cm2
and mean gradient of 18mmHg. Left ventriculogram showed
preserved LV function. Based on the above results, he was
referred for CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent four vessel CABG on [**2153-9-3**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Surgery was uneventful - see op note for further
details. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU in
stable condition. There he was weaned from inotropic support and
was extubated without difficulty. He was noted to have some
ventricular ectopy which improved after intravenous Lidocaine
and PO beta blockade. K and Mg levels were monitored closely and
repleted per protocol. He otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics. Units of PRBCs were intermittently transfused to
maintain hematocrit close to 30%. On POD 1, he transferred to
the SDU.  He remained in a normal sinus - no further ventricular
ectopy was noted. Beta blockade was slowly advanced as
tolerated. Over several days, he made clinical improvements. By
discharge, he was near his preoperative weight with oxygen
saturations over 96% on room air. He also worked daily with
physical therapy and made steady progress. His hospital course
was otherwise uneventful and he was cleared for discharge to
home on POD 5. He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
his local cardiologist in approximately 4 weeks.

old EKG ([**3-16**]): sinus brady @80 with atrial ectopy, low limb

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Initial EKG showed marked depressions in v3-6. On
admission to the CCU, art line was placed, after which pt was
noted to be bradycardic to the 40s and hypotensive to 70s
according to the art line. Pt was bolused with IVF without
significant increase in BP. Dopamine was started. Pt was
asymptomatic. Pt was taken emergently to the cath lab as we were
concerned about acute ischemia. Pt was found to have diffuse
disease and 60-70% stenosis of LCx. In retrospect, pt's
hypotensive episode was most likely spurious, as the arterial
line BP and cuff pressures did not correlate. Cuff pressures did
not drop below 90s systolic during the entire time. Pt may have
some arterial stenosis which led to spurious BP. By cardiac
enzymes, pt was found to have NSTEMI with peak CK of 573 and
peak Tn of 1.09. Pt was started on Aspirin, Statin, plavix. BB
and ACE were initially held in setting of ""hypotension"", but
then was started. Later, decision was made to perform another
cath and to stent the LCx lesion which was done successfully.

2. DM: Pt was admitted in DKA with AG 17. He was started on
insulin drip and IVF and frequent electrolyte checks/repletions.
Gap was successfully closed. Pt was transitioned to insulin
pump.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old male
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% and ICD for
DF/VT.  Here for possible ICD malfunction after he was
shocked three times at home the night before admission to an
outside hospital.  The first shock occurred on the morning
prior to admission with no preceding symptoms.  The second
shock occurred while walking downstairs, and he reported
reaching out his arm.  Third shock occurred shortly after
this when he was reaching out with his left hand, and the
final and fourth shock occurred when he was reaching out in
bed with his left arm and received multiple shocks in a row.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a magnet placed over
his ICD, and was given magnesium sulfate.  He was
hemodynamically stable, and had no complaints otherwise.

On review of symptoms, the patient reported occasional
orthostatic hypotension, but denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient denies fever or
chills.  Denied bloody stools or black stools.  The patient
denied orthopnea, PND, or dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. ICD for VF with second SVC coil because of high DFTs with
three-lead fracture in 03/99.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. CHF with an EF of 15%.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Obesity.
8. History of unsuccessful VT ablation.
9. Osteoarthritis.
10. BPH.
11. Reactive airway disease.
12. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol 50 b.i.d.
2. Vasotec 10 b.i.d.
3. Lasix 40 b.i.d.
4. Imdur 60 q.d.
5. Lanoxin 125 mcg.
6. Levoxyl 125 mcg.
7. Lipitor 40.
8. Plavix 75.
9. Spironolactone 25.
10. Dofetilide 250 q.d.
11. Coumadin 10 two days a week, 7.5 five days a week.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient reports coronary artery disease in
his father.  [**Name (NI) **] also has a 50 pack year smoking history, but
quit 34 years ago.  He denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and
amiodarone which caused edema.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of
80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating
97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three
in no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was
no JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals
regular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.
Faint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks
from his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was
using his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the
fact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was
interrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain
arm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.
The INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan
for future need revision.

Overnight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,
although the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned
to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter
placed.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2126-5-7**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous
pacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR
trended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device
revision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.

After this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]
floors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which
were appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's
pacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.
It was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular
tachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional
episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully
paced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on
lidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia
and the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient
was transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated
this well.  The patient had no further episodes of
significant ventricular tachycardia.

2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no
symptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,
beta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an
aspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his
hospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.
Plan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin
as per his prior home regimen.

3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
An echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an
ejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO
during episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and
aldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,
aldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no
evidence of congestive heart failure during this
hospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before
discharge.

4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was
continued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a
regular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in
normal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of
insulin.

5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.
Remained stable throughout this hospitalization.

6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the
patient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the
evening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with
his cardiologist or primary care physician for further
monitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.

7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5
following his pacemaker placement, and therefore was
continued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given
for prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics, plan for seven-day course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ICD firing.
2. ICD revision.
3. Ventricular tachycardia.

IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, re-do coronary
artery bypass grafting and hypertension, who presented to an
outside hospital with unstable angina.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:
    a) The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting with a
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,
a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery, a
saphenous vein graft to the third obtuse marginal artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
    b) He had re-do coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2170**]
with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending
artery with no bypass grafts to total occlusions of right
coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery grafts.
    c) In [**2172-3-5**], the patient had a stent of the
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery
with a cardiac catheterization showing a left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 17, an ejection fraction of 42% and mid
inferior akinesis and anterolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
    d) In [**2172-6-2**], the patient had a percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of a saphenous vein graft
to the left anterior descending artery with a left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 19.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.9.
5.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was doing well post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172-6-2**].
On [**2172-10-11**], he developed back pain while sitting.
This involved radiation to his left arm and also some
retrosternal chest pain.  He also described some slight
shortness of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  This
episode of chest pain was not initially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and the patient presented to [**Hospital6 18075**].

At [**Hospital6 2561**], the patient was found to have no
acute electrocardiogram changes and laboratory investigation
showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, a
hematocrit of 36.6, a platelet count of 291 and a Chem 7
which was within normal limits with a BUN of 50 and a
creatinine of 1.9.  His CK, MB and troponin I were noted to
be 64, 2.6 and 0.2.  His second set of enzymes were also
normal.  The patient was admitted and his chest pain was
treated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips.  He was also
noted to have an asymptomatic run of ventricular tachycardia
of 27 beats without any hemodynamic compromise.  The patient
was started on a lidocaine infusion at that time.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2172-10-14**] and was taken straight to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.  There, he was found to
have a cardiac output and cardiac index of 3.1 and 1.8
respectively.  His right ventricular end diastolic pressure
was 16 and his pulmonary artery pressures were 48/28 with a
mean of 39.  His wedge pressure was noted to be 29 and his
mixed venous oxygen saturation was 42.  No left ventricular
angiography was done.

Examination of the coronary arteries showed a right dominant
system with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a
99% lesion at the first obtuse marginal artery and a 100%
lesion at the second obtuse marginal artery.  His
posterolateral ventricular branch was noted to be occluded at
30%.  The right coronary artery, which had a previous known
occlusion, was not injected.  The patient's saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending artery stent was found to
be 98% occluded and the patient underwent balloon
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and subsequent
brachytherapy with a residual occlusion of 10%.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of tobacco
use.  He consumed alcohol socially and currently lived alone
without support.  The patient was capable of doing his own
shopping, cooking, cleaning and driving.  He did have a
health care proxy by the name of [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 7049**], who resided
at 74 [**Hospital1 36830**]in [**Hospital1 2436**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no
apparent distress with vital signs showing a temperature of
96.9??????F, a blood pressure of 138/63, a heart rate of 87, a
respiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a
nonrebreather mask.  The neurological examination was
unremarkable.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  On head and neck examination, the pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was moist.

On cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous
pressure was 8-10 cm above the sternal angle.  He had a
normal S1 and S2 with an S3 and S4.  He did not have any
audible murmurs.  The respiratory examination showed diffuse
crackles half way up his chest bilaterally with no wheezes.
The abdominal examination was unremarkable.  The extremities
showed palpable bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses with no
edema.  He had a right groin pulmonary artery catheter line
in place and his arterial sheath site was clean, dry and
intact with no bruit or hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's cardiac care unit laboratory
values showed a white blood cell count of 14,200, hematocrit
of 27.6 and platelet count of 211,000.  Chem 7 showed a
sodium of 129, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate
of 18, BUN of 46, creatinine of 2.1 and glucose of 217.  CK
was 555, calcium was 9.0 and magnesium was 1.6.   Arterial
blood gases showed a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 29 and a pO2 of
90.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient's electrocardiogram on
[**2172-10-12**] showed him to be in sinus rhythm at 60
with a prolonged P-R interval, a normal P wave and a QRS axis
of -60 to -90.  He also had a right bundle branch block with
a left anterior hemiblock.  He had Q waves noted in leads III
and aVF.  He also had some premature ventricular
contractions.  There were T wave inversions in leads V1 to
V4, which appeared unchanged from his electrocardiogram from
[**2172-7-1**].

RADIOLOGY DATA:  The patient's chest x-ray showed significant
pulmonary vascular redistribution cephalad.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following cardiac catheterization, the
patient was continued on Plavix and received aggressive
diuresis for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
On [**2172-10-15**], the patient was noted to have
continued runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an
echocardiogram was done, which showed the patient to have a
moderately depressed left ventricular function with 1+ aortic
insufficiency, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  He also was noted to have inferior and
inferoseptal hypokinesis.  The pulmonary artery catheter was
removed along with the introducer on that day.

On [**2172-10-16**], the patient was noted to be in atrial
bigeminy in the morning and also continued to have short runs
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of three to four
beats.  The patient continued with his intravenous diuresis
with 80 mg of Lasix q.d. and was subsequently transferred to
the floor.  On [**2172-10-17**], the electrophysiology
department was informally consulted and the patient's
metoprolol dose was increased.  The patient's rhythm
continued to be monitored.

On [**2172-10-19**], the patient was in stable condition
with adequate diuresis.  His nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia continued to improve and the patient continued to
show no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient was discharged home on [**2172-10-19**] in
stable condition.

and direct laryngoscopy, tracheal resection and
reconstruction on [**2170-4-4**].  His intraoperative course was
uneventful.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively in an intubated condition.  He remained
intubated overnight and was in a stable condition.

He was extubated on postoperative day one.  He remained in
atrial fibrillation at this time.  He was started on a
diltiazem drip for the atrial fibrillation with a rate
of 150s.  He underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild
anastomotic edema and was therefore continued on diuresis.
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next few days
slowly improving with aggressive respiratory treatment.  His
Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day three.  He was
continued on antibiotics of vancomycin and Flagyl which had
been started in the initial postoperative period.

On postoperative day six, he complained of some left lower
extremity pain.  He underwent a lower extremity noninvasive
study which revealed a left lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.  At this point, he was started on Lovenox as he
was not yet therapeutic on his Coumadin.

On [**2170-4-10**], he underwent another bronchoscopy which
again revealed mucosal edema at the anastomotic site.  In the
next few days in the Intensive Care Unit were essentially
uneventful as he slowly improved, and his respiratory
function was slowly improving.

He was deemed ready for transfer to the regular floor on
postoperative day eight.  He was stable on the floor over the
next few days.  His Coumadin was continued until it reached a
therapeutic level, and at that point the Lovenox was stopped.
He continued to have left leg pain secondary to the deep
venous thrombosis and was treated with a morphine
patient-controlled analgesia.  He had aggressive respiratory
toilet as well at this point.  His clinical condition slowly
improved, and he started ambulating, and his respiratory
function improved as well.

On postoperative day 16 ([**2170-4-20**]), he went back to the
operating room for a bronchoscopy.  At that time, his airways
were clean, and there was no mucosal edema.  He was now ready
for discharge home on Coumadin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82-year-old man
without a past medical history except for longstanding
asthma, who presents to the Emergency Department after having
seen his primary care this morning, and noted to have a
temperature of 103 F.  Patient reports that he was in his
usual state of health last evening, however, but he awoke
this morning feeling generally unwell and subsequently had an
episode of nausea and vomiting with subjective fevers.
Patient denies chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for chronic nonproductive cough.
Negative for pleuritic chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria,
or frequency, diarrhea, or hematochezia.  He denies sick
contacts or travel history.  He has had no hospitalizations
since [**2112**] at which time he had resection of a distal
pancreatic mass and splenectomy.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature was
101.6 with stable vital signs.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.6, blood
pressure 126/42, heart rate 67, respirations 18, and
saturating 96% on room air.  Generally, the patient was in no
acute distress.  HEENT exam was unremarkable.  He had no
lymphadenopathy in the cervical or axillary regions.  Heart
sounds were normal.  Lung exam was significant for coarse
breath sounds.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities:  He had
trace to +1 edema bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 33.5 with
81% neutrophils, 12% bands, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit 42.8,
platelets 545.  Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Lactate was 4.4.
Urinalysis was negative.

Chest x-ray:  Negative for consolidation or effusion.

Blood cultures:  Negative.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit according to the MUST sepsis
protocol.  No infectious source was found.  Patient's white
blood cell count continued to trend down on ceftriaxone,
which he was continued on for five days after which point he
was changed to oral Levaquin for a total of 14-day course.
Despite the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, suspicion
for endocarditis was extremely low, and transthoracic
echocardiogram was also negative for vegetation.  Patient
became afebrile two days after admission and continued to be
afebrile throughout his hospital course.

Lung nodule:  CT torso was done to evaluate potential
abscesses, which could be the source of the patient's fever.
Incidentally, it was noted that patient had a spiculated
noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter from
the left lung apex.  CT Surgery consulted during this
admission, and recommended a repeat CT scan in one month with
outpatient followup.

Asthma/emphysema:  Patient was continued on his Flovent and
Serevent.  He has no record of pulmonary function tests and
this will be done as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Sepsis, fever of unknown origin.
2. Pulmonary nodule seen incidentally on CAT scan.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient was instructed to followup
with his primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] in one week.  He was
also instructed to have a repeat CAT scan on his chest in one
month and this was scheduled for [**2117-1-26**].  He is
also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**], Cardiothoracic Surgery
after this CT scan.  Lastly, he is to followup to get
pulmonary function tests on [**1-20**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Patient was afebrile and
clinically at his baseline.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Serevent 50 mcg one inhalation p.o. q.12h.
2. Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
3. Levofloxacin 500 mg one p.o. q.d. for eight days to
complete a 14-day course.

Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation
2. Permanent Pacemaker Placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and coumadin, CAD with 3VD
seen on cardiac cath in [**2186**], CHF with EF of 20%, who initially
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] last night complaining of a slow heart
beat.  Per his wife at around midnight last night he came to bed
complaining that his heart was beating very slowly, he felt weak
and that he could ""feel it in his chest.""  At that time he asked
his wife to call 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further
evaluation.  Per his wife he did not complain of any chest pain,
shortness of breath or nausea.  Also, the family notes that he
has been having some falls/syncope at home including one event
that he did not remember in the past few weeks.
.
Per EMS report he was found to be pale, cool and diaphoretic on
initial examination.  There he experienced some nausea, vomited
once, appropriate but lethargic, he was found to be bradycardic
to the 20's to 30's and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  En route to
[**Location (un) 620**] he was given atropine 0.5mg x 2 with no effect, he was
put on external pacing with electrical but not mechanical
capture.  At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] he was still bradycardic initially to
the 20's, was given atropine 1mg x 2, a right cordis was placed
and pacing wires were floated but kinked and were unable to
capture.  His CK was 87, CK-MB was 2.1.  He was then intubated
for reported AMS, external pacing was again attempted but there
was no mechanical capture.  Throughout his course he was never
hypotensive with his episodes of bradycardia.  EKG's done at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] showed at times a junctional rhythm, ventricular escape
and then bradycardia with his old LBBB.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER his initial VS were: 96.8, 63,
113/60, 99% on 14x450, 5 PEEP, FiO2 of 100%.  His heart rate
remained in the 50's, he was given fentanyl/versed for sedation,
an OGT was placed and he was transferred to the CCU.  VS on
transfer were: 96, 51, 124/59, 97% on the above ventilator
settings.  His CK was 88, CK-MB was 4 with a troponin of 0.04.
On arrival to the CCU his initial VS were: 97, 43, 130/57, 22,
100% on AC 14x450, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 60%.  He is currently
intubated and sedated, unable to respond to any questions, he is
moving his extremities.

The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis (and inferior akinesis).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-4-7**],
the LV appears more dysynchronous
.
CXR [**2191-2-23**] Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. The
widened mediastinum may represent an enlarged aneurysmal
thoracic aorta or an aortic dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone/coumadin, CAD with 3VD, CHF
with EF of 20% who presented with symptomatic bradycardia.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for permanenet pacemaker placement.
Hospital course complicated by brief intubation for altered
mental status.
.
# RHYTHM / BRADYCARDIA: Review of EKGs prior to admission reveal
sinus arrest after a junctional rhythm and subsequent
ventricular escape.  When he returned into sinus rhythm he had a
wider QRS interval and prolonged PR interval of 300 ms thank on
prior EKGs.  Etiology unclear, may be secondary to conversion
pause or a toxic or metabolic condition pre-empting sinus arrest
with long PR and wide QRS.  A free T4 was normal. The patient's
home dose of amiodarone was held with concern for toxicity.  A
temporary pacemaker was placed and noted to be coiled in the IVC
and was thus subsequently removed.  Coumadin was held in
anticipation of pacemaker placement.  A permanent pacemaker was
placed on HD 2.  Although the patient is a given EF of 20%
candidate for biventricular ICD placement, dicussion with the
patient and primary cardiologist prompted placement of pacemaker
only, to place the simplest device that would address his
bradycardia. Coumadin was restarted post procedure at his home
regimen, with follow-up at the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] coumadin clinic.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has a history of three
vessel disease and was not on a statin or beta blocker as an
outpatient.  He was started on atorvastatin 80mg daily, aspirin
325 mg daily.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and flat.  Lipid
panel revealed an LDL of 105, HDL of 33 and total cholesterol of
173, the atorvastatin was discontinued at the time of discharge.
.
# AIRWAY PROTECTION: The patient was intubated prior to
admission to the intensive care unit due to altered mental
status in the setting of symptomatic bradycardia.  He was
successfully extubated on admission to the CCU.
.
# SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Most recent echo prior to
admission demonstrated EF of 20%. An echo on admission was
similar demonstrating more dysynchronous LV function. The
patient was continued on lisinopril at his outpatient dose of
5mg daily.
.
# HYPERTENSION: All antihypertensive medications were held given
bradycardia, and then restarted after pacemaker placement, he
was discharged on his home regimen.
.
# HYPOTHYROID:  The patient was continued on home synthroid at
225mcg daily.  Free T4 was normal with elevation of TSH.  He was
dischargard on his home dose with outpatient PCP follow up for
further titration of his synthroid.
.
# GLAUCOMA: continued on his outpatient eye drop regimen
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE:
1. CODE: FULL
2. FOLLOW-UP: needs coumadin monitoring and PCP follow up for
titration of his synthroid dose given elevated TSH.  He will
follow up with the EP device clinic and also with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
continued outpatient cardiology care.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**],

You were recently admitted to the Cardiac Intesive Care Unit for
a low heart rate, which made you feel ill. You presented
intubated (tube in your lungs helping you breathe), which was
quickly taken out. You had a pacemaker placed to help keep your
heart rate within a normal range. You tolerated this procedure
well.
.
In the hospital we found that your thyroid is not working
properly. For this reason your thyroid medication (Synthroid)
may need to be adjusted. Please remember to take this medication
daily and follow up with your Primary Care Physician to address
this.
.
We are making a few changes to your outpatient medications:
-Please START Keflex 500mg by mouth every 8 hours for the next
three days
-Please START Tramadol 25mg by mouth every 6hrs as needed for
pain
***This can cause drowsiness, do not take this medication when
doing activity.
-Please continue to take your Coumadin at the same dose (5mg
every day except for 2.5mg on Monday on Friday). We spoke with
the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Location (un) 620**]. Please have your labs
drawn on Tuesday [**2191-3-1**] for PT/INR. They will adjust your dose

Recent testing:
[**2131-4-24**]: Echo showed a normal LV size and function.  EF of
60-65%.  The valves were all normal with trace TR.  Pulmonary
systolic pressure was estimated to be 30-35%. [**2131-4-20**]: Nuclear
stress test where the patient exercised for 6 minutes 57 seconds
on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol stopping due to shortness of breath and leg
pain.  He achieved 68% of his predicted target heart rate.  He
did not develop any arrhythmias or chest pain.  The nuclear
images demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle. There was a
moderate sized reversible perfusion abnormality involving the
anteroapical and septal portion left ventricle. There was also a
question of a small reversible abnormality involving the
inferolateral portion left ventricle.  The left ventricular wall
motion was normal.  The LVEF was 62%.
.
[**2131-4-30**] Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary artery had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.  The LAD was ectatic proximally and occluded in the
mid segment after a small diagonal.  The LCX had a 90% stenosis
of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in
the proximal and mid segment of the OM2. The RCA had a 90%
stenosis in the mid PDA.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately
elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was
121/73 mm Hg).  There was no significant gradient across the
aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated
ejection
fraction of 65%.  No mitral regurgitation was noted. 4.
Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent
renal arteries.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
4. No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2131-5-7**] 11:20 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 yoM s/p CABG and CT removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2131-5-7**].

COMPARISON: [**2131-5-4**]

INDICATION: Chest tube removal.

Various lines and tubes have been removed since the prior
radiograph, and a very small left apical pneumothorax has
developed. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal
limits for postoperative status of the patient. Small pleural
effusions and minor bibasilar atelectasis are noted. These
findings are superimposed upon subtle likely more chronic
peripheral and basilar interstitial lung disease.

On the lateral view, small air-fluid level is present in the
retrosternal region likely representing an anterior
hydropneumothorax, and additional air is present in the
retrosternal region, an expected postoperative finding given the
time interval since surgery.

IMPRESSION: Small left pneumothorax following tube removal.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

Date of Birth:   [**2114-9-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MED Gold

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a significant cardiac history with coronary
artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft),
hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes mellitus who presented with worsening congestive
heart failure of several months in duration with new onset
chest pressure.

The patient was in his usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when he began to experience increasing
shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. However, the
patient was still able to walk his dog for approximately one
half of a mile per day.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  No
orthopnea.  Minimal bilateral lower extremity edema at
baseline.

The patient had one episode of [**5-10**] chest pressure (his
anginal equivalent) with exertion three days prior to
admission which resolved after one hour.

On the day prior to admission, the patient had a second
episode of [**10-10**] chest pressure, substernal, and without
radiation.  No associated nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.
Mild diaphoresis and lightheadedness.  The patient took one
sublingual nitroglycerin, and his pain score went down to
7/10, and he presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department for evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, the
patient's chest pressure was relieved with aspirin, heparin,
nitroglycerin, and Integrilin.  He also received metoprolol
intravenously.  He did continue to be short of breath despite
receiving 80 mg of Lasix intravenously on arrival.

The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a
left bundle-branch block and left atrial abnormality, without
any significant changed when compared to the previous tracing
of [**2183-2-22**].  His initial creatine kinase was 326
with a troponin T of 0.31.

Of note, the patient denies fevers or chills.  He has a
slight cough with sputum.  He is not on a low diet.  No
recent dietary indiscretion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory for
coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired painter.  He has
been married times 44 years.  He has a 60-pack-year history
of tobacco; he quit 15 years ago.  Occasional alcohol use.
No intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 133/64, his heart rate was
107, his respiratory rate went from 40 to 24, and his oxygen
saturation was 95% on 2 liters.  In general, an elderly
gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   Extraocular movements were intact.  The neck
was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.  Normal
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs,
rubs, clicks, or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  No rales
or wheezes.  The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremity examination revealed
2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed creatine kinase was 326, CK/MB was 14,
troponin T was 0.25, and MB index was 4.3.  His white blood
cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 33, and his platelets
were 281.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.2, chloride was
99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 24,
creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 303.  Prothrombin
time was 13.8, partial thromboplastin time was 25.2, and his
INR was 1.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated
cardiomegaly with pulmonary vasculature redistribution and a
new lingular opacity (pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary
edema), and a small calcified granuloma in the right upper
lobe (as previously demonstrated).

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, placed on
telemetry, and continued on his outpatient cardiac
medications, as well as a nitroglycerin, heparin, and
Integrilin drips.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  At baseline, the
patient had been on 2 liters nasal cannula of home oxygen.
His oxygen requirement remained stable while in house on 3
liters nasal cannula.  He was saturating at 97%.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**2183-8-21**] which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20% with global
hypokinesis; consistent with prior examination.

The patient was continued on digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once
per day and Lasix 80 mg intravenously once per day.  Daily
weights and strict ins-and-outs were monitored.  On the day
of discharge, the patient no longer had edema of the lower
extremities.  He was saturating at 100% on 2 liters with his
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in by
enzyme criteria; however, his electrocardiogram continued to
be unchanged with a left bundle-branch block at baseline.

There was consideration of catheterization during this
inpatient stay; however, given the patient's complications
with gastrointestinal bleeds, as well as his reluctance to
undergo this procedure, this was deferred.

The patient underwent a chemical stress MIBI on [**2183-8-26**]; during which time he had no anginal symptoms or
interpretable electrocardiogram changes.  By verbal report,
the nuclear portion of this study demonstrated fixed defects
in the anterior/inferior walls with an ejection fraction of
20% and left ventricular cavity enlargement.

3.  ANEMIA/GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an
episode of melena on the morning of [**2183-8-22**].  He
denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis,
coffee-grounds emesis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He had never had symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding in the
past.

A nasogastric lavage demonstrated no active upper
gastrointestinal bleed, and his vital signs remained stable
with a stable hematocrit at 29.8.  Two large-bore intravenous
lines were placed, and the patient was transfused a total of
three units of packed red blood cells with 80 mg of
intravenous Lasix prior to this transfusion.  He was also
started on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.  The
Integrilin, heparin, and aspirin were held.

A Gastroenterology consultation was obtained, and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended and performed on
the morning of [**2183-8-23**].  This demonstrated gastritis.
Nevertheless, due to the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding
he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because
of concern over the initial hematocrit drop from 33 to 26
with a question of potential retroperitoneal bleed.

On [**2183-8-22**], when he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, an abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography without contrast was obtained which demonstrated
some cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis, and
no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

An anemia workup was continued, and iron studies demonstrated
an elevated ferritin and decreased total iron-binding
capacity suggesting likely anemia of chronic disease with
acute anemia secondary to gastritis superimposed.

The patient remained stable and was transferred back to the
C-MED Service on the evening of [**2183-8-23**].  For the
duration of his inpatient course, the patient's hematocrit
remained stable at 32.7, and he did not experience subsequent
episodes of melena or hematemesis.

Of note, the aspirin, heparin, and Integrilin continued to be
held (this contributed to the unwillingness to perform
cardiac catheterization during this inpatient stay).

4.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  On admission chest x-ray, the patient
was noted to have a lingular infiltrate that was felt to be
new compared to prior studies.  Of note, the patient's white
blood cell count was 7.8, but he did spike to 102.3 degrees
Fahrenheit on [**2183-8-22**].  Thus, it was felt that the
chest x-ray infiltrate was consistent with pneumonia, and he
was started on levofloxacin 500 mg once per day for a 10-day
course.

The patient's chest x-ray gradually improved during his
inpatient stay.  On the day of discharge, his temperature was
99.6 with a white blood cell count of 13.3.  Of note, his
maximum white blood cell count had been 13.9.  The patient
had been afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an
insulin sliding-scale with four times per day fingersticks.
His glucose remained within normal limits during this
hospital course.

6.  MENTAL STATUS CHANGE ISSUES:  The patient was minimally
agitated during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.  It was
felt that this was likely baseline dementia with superimposed
Intensive Care Unit delirium.  He did have a recent head
computed tomography which showed no acute event.

Of note, his mental status was much improved upon transfer to
the floor.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**2183-8-26**].  His vital signs were stable.  He was saturating at
100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His creatine kinase levels
had been dropping from 187 to 108 with a troponin of 0.31.
He was asymptomatic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute non-ST-segment myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6157**]
Chief Complaint:
epididymitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incision and drainage of Fournier's gangrene

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male who was transferred from an
outside hospital because of a suspected myocardial infarction on
[**2166-8-10**] and possible need for cardiac catheterization.  He was
admitted to the cardiology service initially.  His symproms
actually began six days prior to admission with flu-like
symptoms.  Then five days prior to admission, the patient began
complaining of a painful lump in his left testicle.  His
symptoms gradually worsened, with increasing pain, erythema, and
edema of his left testicle.  In addition, he complained of
difficulty urinating for two days prior to admission.  He was
admitted to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
here, at which time a Foley catheter was placed and he was
started on IV Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (which was switched
to Levofloxacin and Vancomycin the following day) for
epididymitis diagnosed by ultrasound.  The ultrasound also
showed questionable air in the scrotum.  The patient was seen by
a urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as an infectious disease
specialist.  He denied any trauma to his scrotum.  He has no
significant urologic history.  His prostate examination revealed
a 20 to 25 gram nonfluctuent prostate.  He is not diabetic and
he is not immunocompromised.  He reported that his pain has been
improving on the antibiotics.  However, on the night prior to
admission he developed acute pulmonary edema, shortness of
breath, hypotension and EKG changes suggestive of myocardial
infarction (ST elevation in leads V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**] depression in
V5-6).  His peak troponin was 0.96.  Neo-synepherine was started
upon admission because of hypotension, which was presumed to be
secondary to sepsis.  Significant cardiac history includes a
CABG in [**2141**], hypertension, aortic stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, high cholesterol, and congestive heart failure
(EF of 40%).  Upon re-evaluation at this hospital, his EKG
changes were thought to be secondary to demand ischemia, rather
than a myocardial infarction.  In addition, the patient was
noted to be in acute renal failure, with a createnine of 1.8 on
admission, likely due to prerenal causes.  Blood and urine
cultures from the outside hospital were all negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2166-8-10**] for presumed myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,
which was later attributed to demand ischemia due to sepsis.  He
was initially started on neo-synephrine for hypotension.  He was
continued on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for his epididymitis.
The urology team saw and evaluated the patient as a consult
service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**].  Our suspicion of Fournier's gangrene
at that time was very low, considering his lack of risk factors
and lack of significant groin erythema, however a CT scan of his
abdomen and pelvis was ordered to rule out Fournier's.  That CT
scan confirmed the diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene on the
morning of hospital day two (tracking of air around his left
hemi scrotum tracking up the left spermatic cord.  At that time,
the patient was emergently rushed to the operating room for
emergent surgical debridement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], chief
urology resident.  During the operation, the patient had the
majority of his left scrotum and all of his left testicle
removed.  He was then admitted to the trauma intensive care
unit.  He was sedated on Propofol with Fentanyl for pain.  He
was started on a Levophed drip to maintain blood pressure.  A
central venous line was placed, as well as a Swann Ganz
catheter.  An oro-gastric tube was placed and put to gravity.
His Foley was continued from the operating room.  Dressing
changes to his scrotum were scheduled for three times per day.
On postoperative day two, his maximum temperature was 101.0.
His Levophed drip was weaned to a low level. Tube feeds were
started through his NG tube.  On postoperative day three, the
plastic surgery service began their evaluation of the patient
for future closure of his wound.  His propofol was discontinued.
 His Levophed was discontinued.  He vomited twice and his tube
feeds were held for high residuals.  He recieved one unit of red
blood cells for a hematocrit under 30, and his hematocrit
responded well.  His acute renal appeared to have resolved, as
his createnine dropped down to 1.0.  On postoperative day four,
his ventillator was weaned to pressure support, however he had
some apneic spells.  A HIT panel was negative and his
subcutaneous heparin was restarted.  He had some bedside
debridement by the urology team and his wound looked like it was
healing well.  He was transfused with another unit of red blood
cells.  The patient was noted to be roughly twenty liters
positive and diuresis with a Lasix drip was started as
tolerated.  On postoperative day seven, the patient required
some propofol for sedation due to endotracheal tube and
oro-gastric tube irritation.  A sputum culture came back
positive for MRSA sensative to Vancomycin.  His wound cultures
were positive for mixed flora including Bacteroides, Provatella,
and coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  A wound VAC was placed
by urology.  On postoperative day eight, a post-pyloric feeding
tube was placed by interventional radiology because the patient
was not tolerating tube feeds via the oro-gastric tube.  On
postoperative day nine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] agreed to allow placement of a
tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube at a later date.  The patient
had been unable to tolerate a ventillator wean up to this point,
most likely due to his fluid overload and his cardiac history.
Tube feeds were running at agoal of 90ml/ hour.  On
postoperative day ten, his Flagyl and Levofloxacin were
discontinued.  He was transfused one unit of blood for a
hematocrit less than thirty.  On postoperative day twelve, he
recieved another unit of red blood cells.

On POD 14, a #8 percutaneous trach was placed at the bedside.  A
perc PEG was placed uner direct visualization, but the tube was
pulled through the abdominal wall.  The patient was subsequently
taken to the OR for an open gastrostomy tube which was placed
without further complication.  Vancomycin was stopped on [**8-25**]
after a complete 14-day course.  On [**2166-8-27**], the wound was
closed primarily at the bedside by the plastic surgery service.
TF were restarted on [**2166-8-27**] and advanced as tolerated.  A PICC
line was also placed on [**2166-8-27**].  Propofol was d/c'd on [**2166-8-28**].
 ON [**2166-8-28**], the patient spiked a temp to 102.  Cultures were
drawn and the A-line tip sent for culture as well.  [**2166-8-29**] tube
feeds were held for high residuals, an ileus was found on
imaginig.  PT evaluation occured on [**2166-8-29**].  Trach mask trials
were started on [**2166-8-28**] and the vent weaned as tolerated, with
the patient still requring vent assistance most of the day.
Vancomycin was restarted on [**2166-8-30**] for MRSA sputum; it will be
continued for 7 days; the JP drain was removed on this day as
well.  TF were restarted on [**2166-9-1**] and brought to goal over the
next day.  The patient is now tolerating TF at goal with bowel
movements.

On [**2166-9-3**], the patient was tolerating TF at goal, having bowel
movements, tolerating trach mask trials daily, was working with
PT, had good pain control with roxicet elixer, was alert and
requring no sedation.  He was subsequently transfered to rehab
for physical therapy and vent weaning.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided high frontal stereotactic biopsy, CT-guided target
point, definition and MRI-guided intraoperative imaging.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of colon
cancer, as well as testicular cancer, who presents with
progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait for approximately 12 months. He was worked up including an
MRI scan that showed a brainstem lesion. He was referred to the
brain tumor clinic for consideration of a biopsy.

The patient has been followed at the [**Hospital6 **] at [**Location 10050**]. He had been treated for a number of medical issues. He
was examined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66170**] whose physical exam reportedly
showed bilateral facial numbness and swaying, and a MRI of the
head was preformed. This demonstrated expansion of the
brainstem without significant contrast enhancement. The patient
was thus considered to have a brainstem glioma and started on
Decadron. The patient now presents for a surgical opinion. In
the office, the patient complains about dizziness, blurred
vision, double vision, occasional headaches, and unsteady gait.
He feels better with medications. He takes at baseline 2 Tylenol
a day. Has a history of arthritis in the lower back, otherwise,
he reports that the numbness in his hands has disappeared since
starting the Decadron. The patient has tapered his Decadron to a
dose of 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient is otherwise feeling
himself stable. He was told that he had a left lazy eye at
baseline, but the patient is not quite sure about the symptoms.
He denies otherwise any extreme fatigue, weight loss or other
symptoms.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Sigmoid colon cancer [**2125**]
Testicular cancer s/p Left orchiectomy and was found to be a
germ cell tumor T1, N0.was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy no
radiation.
Hemorrhoids
Recurrent bouts of thrush


Social History:
He is a high school graduate. He is an electrician. He is
divorced. He has no other people in the household. He has a
40-pack-year history of smoking. He drinks about three drinks a
week, and he denies any recreational drug use.



Family History:
His mother died at 63 of a heart attack. His father died at 44
after a MVA. He has two sisters 58 and 54, the 54-year-old has
gallbladder stones. Other than that, they both are healthy.
There are two brothers, one brother at 47 who has
hypertension and two daughters that are in good health.


Physical Exam:
GENERAL: He is alert, pleasant, middle-aged man in no acute
distress. Weight was 170 pounds, height was 74 inches, blood
pressure was 154/90, pulse of 96, respirations 20, temperature
of 97.4.

HEENT: The patient did have a head tilt to the left.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or
rubs.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

NEUROLOGIC: The patient is awake, alert and oriented. He has
bilateral reactive pupils. Eye movements are full and we cannot
detect a clear deficit of a particular muscle, at current, the
patient has no diplopia. Visual fields seem to be fully intact.
He has non-exhaustible end gaze nystagmus with rotatory
component. Face is symmetric. Tongue is midline. No
fasciculations. He has a hoarse voice. He has full strength
bilaterally. He has intact sensation and symmetric reflexes. The
patient does not have any memory problems, blackouts, nausea,
concentration, or speech problems, as well as hearing problems.
On motor examination, he was [**4-24**] bilaterally, normal tone, no
drift. I found no evidence of any weakness in his hands. Upper
sensory, he was intact to light touch throughout, and he was
intact to pinprick over in the hands
Reflexes were 2+ throughout.
Cerebellar: He had bilateral intention tremor in the hands as
well as finger tapping and rapid alternating movements were
fine. Foot tapping and heel-knee-shin was normal.
Gait: He had a wide based gait, he is unable to toe tandem or

Pathology [**2132-12-31**]:
MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE/PONS STEREOTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY
(including intraoperative smear):
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING FIBRILLARY ASTROCYTOMA. WHO ([**2126**]) grade
II out of IV.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 M with PMH sigmoid and testicular ca in [**2125**], HTN, COPD,
admitted for new diagnosis pontine glioma s/p posterior fossa
decompression and necrotizing pna.
.
# Pontine glioma:
56 year-old man initially seen and discussed in brain tumor
clinic. Patient taken to OR on [**12-31**] for brainstem lesion biopsy
under general anesthesia. Postoperatively stayed in the PACU 6
hours then transferred to floor. On postop day one patient
demonstrated difficulty of swallowing which he failed his speech
and swallow evaluation. Patient kept NPO, started IV fluids. On
[**2133-1-2**] patient taken back to OR for a suboccipital chiari
decompression. Patient tranferred to neuro ICU for hemodymanic
and neurologic monitoring. Due to postoperaive respiratory
secretion extubated on [**2133-1-4**] after bronchcospy.
.
Brain stem biopsy pathology result is significant for
infiltrative astrocytoma. Radiation oncology decided not to
perform radiation mapping and to hold off for another several
weeks before planning to start XRT, since patient has a slow
growing glioma, and XRT could exacerbate pna.  Patient known by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] will follow up with him as scheduled.  Patient was
transferred to Step-down unit on [**2132-1-7**].  His speech continued
to become more articulate and clear, and his mental status
continued to become more clear.  The patient stated that his
dizziness has improved.
.
# Necrotizing pneumonia:
Patient has a known pulmonary process that been followed in
[**Hospital 669**] [**Hospital **] hospital in MA. In house repeat CT of the chest
significant for left lower lobe, consolidative opacity, with
central area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and
low-attenuation material. Additionally, there are several areas
within the right and left lungs peripherally, with patchy
opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning for multifocal
opacity. There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower
lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.There is a
3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within
the left lower lobe. Attempt to obtain images from [**Hospital **] hospital
regarding pulmonary lesions for comparison, [**Name (NI) 653**] with
MEdical records to sent ua CD images. Medicine and
interventional pulmonary services recommended continue
antibiotics, and follow up with chest CT with and with out
contrast in 4 weeks in pulmonary clinic. In the mean time
[**Name (NI) 653**] with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding
tranfering him over to VA regarding his known pulmonary process,
and colon carcinoma for further work up which he was agreed with
the transfer.
.
Pleural fluid culture grew out positive to MSSA, GNR, [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
albicans, staph coag neg. BAL culture grew out Stenotrophomonas
maltophila and Klebsiella sensitive to almost all abx tested.
ID was consulted and created antibiotic regimen of clindamycin,
bactrim, ceftriaxone, to be continued for 4-6 weeks.  Levo was
completed for 2 weeks (last date [**2133-1-27**]).  Patient should be
reassessed to refine abx regimen within 2-4 weeks.  The patient
greatly improved on suctioning and chest PT, maintaining >95% RA
on the floor.
.
The following labs will need to be followed up after discharge:
LFTs, mycolytic/fungal cx, Cdiff x3, legionella urinary antigen
.
# Urinary retention:
Patient had no urine output after foley was d/ced.  Straight
cath released 980 ml of urine.  After 2 days of straight caths,
patient recovered normal urination, and does not have a foley
upon discharge.
.
# Skin lesions:
Dermatology consulted in reference to his left deltoid skin
lesion, non-bleeding which is present for 5 year according to
patient. Dermotalogy recommended excision of the lesion to rule
out melanoma once acute issues resolved with Derm Surgery
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2977**]).
.
# Anemia:
Patient's Hct was around 25 during admission.
.
# HTN:
Controlled.  Diltiazem and captopril were continued as per her
outpt regimen.
.
# Access: Picc placed [**2133-1-9**].

Medications on Admission:
The patient is a 56 y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] with a PMH significant for sigmoid
and testicular cancer in '[**25**], HTN, and COPD who was admitted to
the neurosurgery service on [**2132-12-31**] with a new diagnosis of a
pontine mass after 1yr of progressive dizziness and ataxia. He
underwent a stereotactic bx on [**12-31**] showing a low grade glioma
and received a palliative posterior fossa expansion on [**1-2**].
.
Routine pre-op CXR revealed multiple opacities and a 3x3 cm well
demarcated cavitary lesion with an air/fluid level in left
posterior lung. Following his surgery, he was extubated w/out
event but required reintubation later that evening [**1-22**]
desaturation.  On [**1-3**], a chest CT was done which showed a
multifocal pneumonic process with LLL necrotizing PNA. He
underwent a bronch on [**1-4**] with BAL revealing MSSA and
stenotrophamonas and was started on Levofloxacin (now d10/14),
Vanco (since d/c), and Clinda (d10/42) at this time. Bactrim
(d5/14) was added on [**1-8**] when BAL grew stenotrophamonas.
.
During this time, he has been intermittantly hypoxic with thick
secretions requiring frequent suctioning.  Over the past 2d, he
has been afebrile and his secretions have cleared appreciably.
He has maintained his O2 sats on 4L NC.  Other than this, the
patient has been intermittantly hypertensive requiring the
addition of captopril to his outpatient regimen.  He has also
failed numerous speech and swallow evaluations requring NG tube
feeds to maintain his nutritional status.  From an oncologic
standpoint, his pontine lesion is not amenable to resection and
the plan is to initiate palliative radiation therapy.  Per
neurosurgery, his prognosis is extremely poor.  Finally, the
patient has requested transfer to the [**Location 1268**] VA system
over the past several days as he has received much of his care
at this hospital.  Discussions are still ongoing to facilitate
this transfer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 40239**] is a 42-year-old
gentleman injured in a motorcycle versus car accident.  The
patient was the passenger of the motorcycle.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No prior medical problems.

MEDICATIONS:  No outpatient medications.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the
Trauma Bay where he underwent full evaluation and
resuscitation by the trauma team.  The patient was found to
have a left open comminuted fracture of the left lower
extremity with a significant degloving injury.  The patient
was taken to the Operating Room for washout and external
fixation of the patient's fracture by the orthopedic team.
In addition, the patient received a consult from the vascular
surgery team which determined that the patient was vascularly
intact.  Following his initial washout, the patient was taken
to the Intensive Care Unit for close observation.

On hospital day #2, the patient was transferred to the floor
as he had been hemodynamically and neurologically stable.  On
hospital day #4, the patient was taken to the Operating Room
again for a combined procedure with the orthopedic and
plastic surgery team.  Orthopedic team placed an
intramedullary nail into the patient's left tibia.  A plastic
surgery team then covered the patient's open defect with a
rectus free flap.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and there were no intraoperative complications.  The patient
was initially monitored in the stepdown Intensive Care Unit
for close observation of this flap.  The patient also had a
split thickness skin graft placed over the flap, as the
patient had significant loss of skin tissue from his
degloving injury.  The patient did well after surgery and
flap had no complications.  Throughout his stay, the patient
continued to have a strong Dopplerable signal both arterial
and venous and a good take of his skin graft.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was transferred to the
floor as he no longer required hourly flap checks.  Beginning
on postoperative day #5, the patient was allowed to begin
dangling his left lower extremity which he tolerated without
any problems.  On postoperative day #7, the patient was seen
by the physical therapist for instructions on non weight
bearing of the left lower extremity transfers to chair.  At
this point, the patient was medically stable and ready for
discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

Throughout his stay, the patient was also given aspirin q day
and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous
heparin.  The patient was also on Kefzol for the duration of
his stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was stable during
discharge.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility, as the patient will have orthopedic
ambulatory difficulties given his non weight bearing status
on his left lower extremity.  He will continue to be non
weight bearing on the left lower extremity with dangling
only, however the patient may transfer to a chair as long as
his left lower extremity is elevated.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Keflex 500 mg po qid
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day
3.  Lopressor 25 mg po bid
4.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn
5.  Colace 100 mg po bid
6.  Zolpidem 5 mg po q hs prn

OTHER INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient may begin showering or
having a spray of water over his wound, however the patient
is not to have any tub soaks.  The patient should not
progress on his weight bearing status until after his follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post ERCP bleed and transfer out of
SICU.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant
73-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant
for multiple myeloma, peptic ulcer disease, cholangitis, iron
deficiency anemia, B12 deficiency anemia, status post
cholecystectomy and appendectomy, who was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 **] for
an ERCP.  The patient had an ERCP that was done on [**2-9**], and had a stent placed with no significant findings
except for mild dilatation, but no stones or strictures.  The
patient had developed gram-negative (Klebsiella grown and E.
coli) rod sepsis and jaundice prior to the first ERCP.

The patient did well for a few days, and then on [**2-18**],
presented with a one day history of right upper quadrant
pain, no nausea, vomiting, fever, or rigors.  A MRI that was
done after [**2-9**] showed abnormal tissue in the region of
porta hepatis and some lymphadenopathy.  So patient was
transferred here for a repeat ERCP.

During the ERCP procedure, the initial contrast revealed an
amorphous intraductal mass.  With further manipulation and
extraction of the mass, there was an old blood clot and once
the blood clot was removed, bright red blood began to drain
from the biliary system.  The GI fellow estimated about 1
unit of blood loss.  The patient was stable and alert during
and after the procedure, and was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further management and eventually to
Interventional Radiology for an A-gram.

An A-gram was done that showed no active bleeding, however,
the stent that was placed in the common bile duct was no
longer there.  The patient was then transferred to the floor
after the hematocrit had been stable for greater than 24
hours and there was no evidence of any new acute bleed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2128**].
2. Peptic ulcer disease.
3. Cholangitis.
4. Iron deficiency anemia.
5. B12 deficiency anemia.
6. Status post cholecystectomy in [**2128**].
7. Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Iron 325 mg po q day.
2. Colace 100 mg po bid.
3. Levaquin 500 mg po q day.
4. Ambien 5 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his brother, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **], and the patient denies any alcohol, smoking, or IV
drug abuse at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE UNIT:  Temperature of 97.0,
blood pressure 130/55, heart rate of 105, respiratory rate
20, and O2 saturation 100% on room air.  General:
Comfortable, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Moist mucosal
membranes.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2 slightly tachycardic, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops heard.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, mild tenderness
in the epigastric area to deep palpation, decreased bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin:  No evidence of any rash.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves
II through XII tested grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 5.3, hematocrit 21.2,
platelets of 301, sodium 133, potassium 3.1, chloride 106,
bicarb 20, BUN 13, creatinine 0.4, glucose 117, ALT 303, AST
167, alkaline phosphatase 704, total bilirubin 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after
an ERCP because of a bleed.  The patient's hematocrit at that
time was 21.2 and the patient received 2 units and hematocrit
was checked q6h for 24-48 hours.  His hematocrit continued to
remain stable between 25-27, however, one additional unit of
blood was given when the patient was transferred to the floor
and his hematocrit continued to remain stable in the range of
29-31.  The patient also had a repeat CT angiogram for
pancreatic protocol that was done on [**2-23**], and it was
found that there was no evidence of any mass and patient had
a dilated common bile duct with wall thickening and
enhancement which is consistent with either hemobilia or
cholangitis.

However, patient's findings were most likely secondary to his
hemobilia since he did have a bleed after his ERCP.  In
addition, the CT angiogram did show extensive bony
involvement of his multiple myeloma.  Also during the
hospital course, the patient was started on broad antibiotic
coverage consisting of ampicillin, Flagyl, and Levaquin for
prophylaxis against developing cholangitis.  During the
hospital course, the patient did not seem to have any right
upper quadrant tenderness or epigastric tenderness that would
be concerned with cholangitis, and on the date of discharge,
he was sent with Levaquin 500 mg po q day for seven
additional days.

The patient's diet was also slowly advanced.  He was made NPO
after his procedure for about two days and was started on a
liquid diet and then eventually into a soft diet all of which
the patient tolerated well.

2. Oncology:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma,
and as per the CT angiogram, it appears that there is
extensive metastases to the bones.  A brief discussion was
brought up with the patient regarding further management, and
if he wanted to see an oncologist at that time, he said that
his care is provided by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49935**] in the [**Location (un) 5871**]
area, and patient would want to talk to him before pursuing
any further intervention.  However, the patient would prefer
to let it be as it is, and did not appear to be interested in
any chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, or even talking to an
oncologist during this hospital course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post ERCP bleed.
2. Multiple myeloma.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is stable at time of
discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg po q day.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day x7 days.
3. The patient is to continue taking all of his outpatient
medications.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient was asked to setup an appointment with
his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 49935**] in the next 3-4 days.
The patient states that he would call and setup an
appointment, according to his own time.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-11-21**] for elective
surgical management of his aortic stenosis. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement utilizing a 25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was initially
slightly confused requiring a sitter however his mental status
slowly cleared. Later on postoperative day one, he was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
monitoring. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. Beta blockade was discontinued for low blood pressure.
The physical therapy service was consulted to help increase his
postoperative strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] developed
atrial fibrillation which converted spontaneously back into
normal sinus rhythm. Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative
day six. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
Beta blockade should be resumed as an outpatient when his blood
pressure can tolerate.

IMAGING:
MRI HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute
infarct. There are no enhancing abnormalities. There is
increased T1 signal within the basal ganglia prior to the
administration of IV contrast. These findings are commonly seen
in patients with liver failure. There is no midline shift, mass
effect, or hydrocephalus. No areas of abnormal magnetic
susceptibility are noted. Normal vascular flow voids are
present.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of an enhancing abnormality or mass.

No acute infarct.

Increased T1 signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally consistent
with the patient's history of hepatic failure.
.
TEE:
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). The posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous
lidocaine. No TEE related complications. 0.1 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe
insertion.
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
.
RUQ Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic
paracentesis.
2. Hepatopetal flow of the main portal vein
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND:
The right kidney measures approximately 11.8 cm and the left
kidney measures approximately 11.5 cm. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis or renal lithiasis bilaterally. Areas of ascites
are again demonstrated throughout the abdomen. No focal bladder
wall masses are identified in the prostate appears slightly
enlarged measuring approximately 5.1 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of hyrdronephrosis or renal lithiasis.
2. Mild prostatic hypertrophy.
3. Abdominal ascites
.
BONE SCAN
IMPRESSION:
1) No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
2) Linear increased
lower sacral uptake consistent with a fracture.
3) Marked, diffuse bilateral increased renal uptake is
non-specific and may be secondary to interstitial nephritis


Brief Hospital Course:
38 y/o M w/ Alcohol/HepC cirrhosis with admitted with s. aureus
bacteremia, and seizure.
.
1) [**Name (NI) 11646**] unclear source.  Patient did not have localizing
signs or symptoms (other than chronic abdominal pain) and did
not have a history c/w meningitis/meningoencephalitis.  He
underwent TTE and TEE while in the ICU, both w/o evidence of
vegetation.  Surveillance cultures remained negative (although
all drawn on abx) and patient was w/o evidence of embolic or
immunologic phenomena on examination.  He remaineed afebrile in
house.  He also underwent bone scan to r/o occult osteomyelitis,
which did not show evidence of infectious focus.  LP was
deferred per neuro recommendations- it was felt that the patient
had been on antibiotics for approximately 5days on transfer from
OSH and his coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia would induce
additional risk for the procedure.  At the OSH, the patient was
initially started on vancomycin and CTX.  When sensitivities
returned as MSSA the patient was switched to nafcillin.  He
completed 12 days of antibiotic therapy and subsequently
developed ARF (Cr peaked at 3.5) but rapidly recovered.
FENA>1%, u/s neg, eos neg (including peripheral), sediment
bland.  Bone scan did show evidence of increased renal uptake
c/w intersitial nephritis.  He completed the last two days of a
total 14 day course with vancomycin.   He was afebrile on
discharge, w/ plan to obtain repeat blood cultures on Monday
[**1-24**].
.
2) [**Name (NI) **] unclear etiology. Patient w/o sz hx.  Interestingly,
the patient seized at the OSH on hospital d3.  This course was
concerning for etoh w/d but patient vehemently denies further
alcohol use.   He was initially loaded on dilantin and
subsequently maintained on keppra.   EEG did not show evidence
of sz focus.  Plan for patient to f/u w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] of Neurology.
.
3) Acute hepatitis- patient admitted to OSH with AST of approx
80, ALT approx 40.  These trended down following admission but
the patient subsequently developed a cholestatic appearance on
labs, with his bilirubin peaking at 15.7 and INR at 2.7.  Both
were trending down on discharge.  Again, the patient denied
alcohol use.
.
4) ARF- likely interstitial nephritis, as discussed above
.
5) ESLD- on discharge, plan to start re-start diuretics pending
evaluation of renal function on Monday.  Patient was continued
on lactulose in house.
.
6) Abdominal Pain - chronic abdominal pain in house.  Minimal
ascites but underwent ultrasound guided paracentesis that ruled
out SBP.
.

Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
male with a history of GERD, standing with substernal chest
pain while working at a construction site, which he thought
was his GERD, then worsened in a few hours.  After about 2
hours, he went to the emergency department.  The pain was
radiating down both arms with his chest pressure.  No nausea,
diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  In the emergency
department, he was found to have lateral ST elevations in V4
through V6 and ST elevations in 2 equal to 3 and aVF.  He
went into ventricular fibrillation arrest.  In the emergency
department, he was shocked to normal sinus rhythm, given
thrombolysis with TNK.  At 4:52 a.m., he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent catheterization.  At the catheterization,
they found right ventricular pressure of 38/14, pulmonary
capillary wedge mean pressure at 25, and 98 percent
thrombotic occlusion in OM1.  PTCA and stent with heparin-
coated stent was placed.  ST elevations resolved after
catheterization and patient was pain free.  Patient then
developed automated idioventricular rhythm after TNK at
outside hospital.  On arrival after catheterization here, he
was pain free with small right groin hematoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Stable vital signs and normal sinus
rhythm.  His temperature afebrile, heart rate 73, blood
pressure 128/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 95
percent on 2 liters.  Generally, in no acute distress.  Alert
and oriented x 3.  No carotid bruits.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes moist.  JVP at 10 cm.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.  Trace dorsalis pedis pulses, 2 plus
posterior pulses bilaterally.  Small right groin hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.8, hematocrit 40.6,
platelets 269, INR 1.3, sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride
104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 108.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ischemia.  Patient had inferior ST
elevation MI.  He was given thrombolysis at the outside
hospital but was transferred for persistent pain and ST
elevations.  His PTCA here was a heparin coated stent to the
OM 1.  He was given aspirin, Plavix, Lopressor, Lipitor 80
mg, and started on ACE inhibitor.  CK is peaked at 3869.
Pump likely moderate-sized inferolateral MI.  Echocardiogram
showed left atrial elongation, mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis,
mild dilated aortic root, trivial MR ejection fraction of 30
percent.  He was started on Coumadin and heparin for
increased risk of thrombosis with no telemetry events.  He
will have a signal-average EKG and follow up with
electrophysiology for T-wave alternans in 3 to 4 weeks.

Cocaine use.  Patient has been counseled regarding the risk
of using cocaine including risk of MI and CVA as well as
sudden death.  He was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**] and given phone
numbers for several detoxification programs.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Patient was discharged to home.

FOLLOWUP PLANS:  Patient has to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**], his
new cardiologist and primary care provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will arrange
for the patient to begin a cardiac rehabilitation program.
The patient can go to his office at 11:00 a.m. on [**2170-3-26**].
He has also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding his
signal-average EKG and
T-wave alternans testing for risk of further arrhythmias.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

Chief Complaint:
Admit for carotid angiography and possible intervention.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P stenting of left carotid artery


History of Present Illness:
64 year-old woman, patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with an extensive history of CAD,
now s/p recent left upper lobectomy for lung cancer with an
incidental finding of an old CVA on head CT postoperatively
prompting a workup that revealed 90% left internal carotid
stenosis on duplex, vs 55% on CTA of neck, now referred for left
carotid angiography to more clearly define her carotid anatomy,
and carotid intervention, if appropriate. Events were as
follows:
[**2128-9-28**] IMI - Treated with stenting of the RCA and LCx. Found
to have severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**] and was referred for
surgical repair.
[**2128-10-27**] Mitral valve surgery aborted after TEE at time of
surgery revealed largely normal mitral valve with improvement of
inferior hypokinesis compared to month prior.
[**3-/2129**] Cardiac Catheterization - Total occlusion of RCA stent and
patent LCX stent, mild to mod MR
[**7-/2129**] Pulmonary edema requiring intubation at an OSH. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a cardiac cath revealing T.O RCA and 40% CX
stenosis in prior stent. EF of 30%
[**2129**] AICD placement
[**2135-10-24**] Cath d/t worsening chronic angina and DOE and inferior
ischemia on dobutamine viability study. Angiography revealed 40%

LAD, 40% LCX ISRS, RCA totally occluded with distal filling via
left to right collaterals. S/P Unsuccesful recanalization of the
RCA. FFR of CX lesion demonstrated it to be a hemodynamically
insignificant lesion.
[**2136-2-2**] s/p VATS, left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection d/t adenocarcinoma. Patient d/c'd on [**2-8**] and
readmitted on [**2-13**] d/t mental status changes and hypotension. A
chest CT was done which was negative for a PE. A CT of the head
was done revealing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, but a
hypodensity at the right temporo-occipital junction. This could
represent a late subacute to chronic infarct vs metastatic
disease. A CT with contrast was done the following day revealing
the same findings. A carotid series was therefore ordered and
done on [**2136-2-15**]. This revealed an 80-99% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery and a <40% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery. A TTE was done on [**2136-2-15**]. This
revealed an ef of 40% with 1+MR, small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric LVH. Hypokinesis noted in
the infero-septum, inferior and infero-lateral walls. Akinesis
noted in the basal infero-septum and inferior wall.
.
The patient was subsequently referred to see Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
as an outpatient who has recommended her for carotid angiography
and intervention. The patient was then seen in clinic by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology who is in agreement that the head
CT scan abnormality is very likely an embolic stroke and feels
that left carotid intervention is appropriate. The patient was
also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery who felt that
it is exceedingly unlikely that the lesion on CT scan represents
a malignancy vs. metastasis and cleared her to undergo a carotid
procedure. He recommended repeat head CT in 3 months.
.
Follow up studies have included:
[**2136-2-23**] Chest XRAY: Normal post left upper lobectomy appearance.
No evidence of any cardiopulmonary process.
[**2136-3-8**] CTA of neck: approximately 55% left sided carotid
stenosis at the bifurcation
[**2136-3-20**] CT of brain with and without contrast: No change of
right posterior temporal-occipital region, likely represents a
chronic infarct. Noted to have tortuous basilar artery. Basilary
artery summit positioned to the left of the midline. Just
anterior to the summit is a 2-mm area of contrast
enhancement--Finding could represent very tortuous origin of
left posterior cerebral artery or contigious tiny aneurysm.
.
In terms of symptoms, the patient denies any neurological
deficits, confusion,or lightheadedness. She further denies any
chest pain. She does report having dyspnea after climbing one
flight of stairs.
.
On day of admission, she underwent carotid angiography with
stent placement

OM1 '[**91**], NSTEMI [**7-18**], DM2, RAS who presented to OSH from nursing
home with confusion and diaphoresis. Glucose noted to be in the
30's and given D50 with improvement in mental status. At OSH she
had abdominal pain and a CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast was
performed which showed no evidence of obstruction, free air, or
AAA but had significant bandemia. She was given Ceftriaxone and
flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, SBP in 60's, hypoglycemic to 40's with
abdominal pain. She was guaiac (+) with dark flecks of material
on rectal. An NG lavage was done with bilious material which
cleared with 700cc NS (no blood). Surgery was consulted,
reviewed her CT scans from OSH and felt there was no acute
surgical issue. She was given Vanco x1. U/A was positive, and
patient was given 2 L NS with SBP into 120s and HR 60's. Blood
sugars improved to 140's with 1 amp D50. Blood and urine
cultures drawn. Patient was due for dialysis on the day of
admission. Renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] about missing her HD but felt no
acute need for HD. On admission, patient was unable to recall
preceding events. Does not remember why she was sent in from NH.
Denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Did complain
of some left-sided abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI and PCI, DM2, RAS
presented from OSH with hypoglycemia, hypotension, abdominal
pain, UTI, now normotensive with new epigastic pain and
persistent intermittent hypoglycemia.
--In the MICU, patient treated for UTI and question of urosepsis
with Cipro. Pyelonephritis was considered possible source of
abdominal pain. Urine cultures came back positive for
pansensitive E. coli and patient was continued on Cipro. There
was no growth in blood cultures. She was ruled out for MI with
mild troponin elevation in the setting of renal failure but flat
CKs. Patient was restarted on HD the day following admission.
Her labetolol, norvasc, clonidine, and isosorbide were held. She
had no further hypotension following initial volume
recessitation. However, she continued to be hypoglycemic at
times, thought most likely secondary to persistent blood levels
of glipizide in the setting of renal insufficiency as well as
poor po intake. Patient's po intake began to improve and prior
to transfer to the floor, BGs had improved to 70-140 [**11-16**]. MICU
stay also complicated by epigastric abdominal pain and emesis,
bilious and non-bloody. Pancreatic enzymes and LFTs were normal.
PTT and INR elevated in MICU. Heparin sc stopped. Both trended
down on repeat checks.
.
The morning after transfer, the patient was found to have
increasing nausea and vomiting that was poorly responsive to
anti-nausea meds.  As there was concern for cardiac ischemia, an
EKG was done that showed new T-wave inversions in the lateral
leads. Pt had significan troponin elevation and cardiology was
consulted.  Though the patient was likely having  mild episode
of cardiac ischemia, given the patient's significant
comorbidities and resolvation of symptoms as well as no
hemodynamic compromise, the patient was treated medically with
aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and oxygen.  The patient was
asymptomatic and had downtrending troponins.  For the remainder
of the hospital, the patient has stable vital signs and no other
complaints of chest pressure.
.
# UTI: Urine culture positive for pansensitive E coli. Was
initially treated with cipro, but with the patient's nausea and
vomiting, it was changed to levofloxacin QHD.  Pt now on day 6
of appropriate abx. Currently afebrile. CVA tenderness noted on
admission now resolved. Pyelonephritis possible cause of initial
abdominal pain but no clear evidence of that on CT abdomen from
OSH.
.
# ESRD on HD (Tues/Thurs/Sat)  Pt now on MWF schedule,
nephrology following.
- next session due [**11-20**]
- monitor electrolytes
- continue nephrocaps
.
# EPIGASTRIC TENDERNESS/VOMITING: minimal epigastric tenderness
on exam, +N/V. Unclear etiology. LFTs, pancreatic enzymes
normal. [**Month (only) 116**] be [**3-16**] to gastroparesis given h/o DM and patient
reports chronic N/V prior to admission.  Now asymptomatic, if
persists, nay need gastric emptying study.
.
# DMII: patient p/w hypoglycemia, now resolved. Was likely [**3-16**]
oral hypoglycemics in setting of worsened renal function due to
infection.  Stable finger sticks on day of discharge, pt on
insulin sliding scale
- monitor QID finger sticks
- cont to hold glyburide as was hypoglycemic
- RISS if needed
.
# HTN: Labetalol, clonidine, and norvasc held on admission to
MICU given hypotension. Restarted prior to discharge.
.
# CAD: stable, denies CP. slight troponin elevation likely [**3-16**]
renal failure, but slight elevation likely due to mild ischemic
event, managed medically as pt has multiple comorbities. CK/MB
negative.
- continue ASA, Plavix, statin
.
# Right hip pain- pt given history of falling prior to
admission. X ray on admission showed no signs of occult fracture
though small linear lucency on x ray.  Pt with large hematoma on
hip that precludes anticoagulation.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue levothyroxine
.
# DEPRESSION: continue sertraline
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient at the time of transfer

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma,
status post hyper CVAD therapy and 5 cycles of CHOP, and
recently ICE chemotherapy and collection, being admitted for
auto-BMT.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ([**2118-7-12**])

History of Present Illness:
54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma
diagnosed in [**2115**], with known gastric and jejunal ulcers and
history of small bowel resection for microperforation, admitted
for auto-BMT on [**2118-6-17**]. He was previously treated with
hyper-CVAD (did not tolerate) and 5 cycles of CHOP. His course
was complicated by a bout of hepatitis in [**2118-4-19**] which was
felt to be chemical in etiology and led to weight loss, sprue
exacerbation and relapse. Following his bout of hepatitis, Mr.
[**Known lastname 45745**] was started back on TPN and has been doing well on it. He
was recently teated with a cycle of ICE chemotherapy and
collected in preparation for auto-BMT.

His bone marrow performed at the beginning of [**Month (only) **] revealed some
minimal involvement with his T-cell lymphoma. His liver biopsy
performed on [**2118-4-28**] revealed numerous apoptotic hepatocytes,
multiple small foci of sinusoidal mononuclear inflammation and
enlarged Kupffer cells consistent with acute hepatitis. No
neoplastic cells. Tissue EGD performed on [**2118-5-12**] showed some
involvement by enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma in one
biopsy section.

Past Medical History:
1. Sprue:  Diagnosis [**9-20**], which was refractory to gluten-free
diet at which point prednisone therapy was initiated.  Further
investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of
T cell lymphoma was made.

2. T cell Lymphoma:  As per HPI.

3. Transaminitis:  From [**Date range (1) 45746**] (peak AST 198, ALT 247, alk
phos 1062, negative HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, toxo, VZV, HSV1,
HSV2).  Thought to be secondary to chemo and/or TPN.  Liver bx
revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute
hepatitis.

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] lives with his wife, a nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 42866**] 1 pack of
cigarettes per day, denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

Family History:
Mother with breast cancer. His father died of an unknown cardiac
event at the age 34. Mother, sister and grandmother have
diabetes mellitus.


Physical Exam:
On admission: Temperature 97.9, HR 80, RR 20, BP 86-98/50-64.
General: Cachectic man in NAD.
HEENT: PERRLA. Clear oropharynx.
NECK: JVP not elevated.
CVS: RRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmur, rub or gallop.
RESP: CTA bilaterally.
ABD: Soft and non-tender. No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally, 2+ peripheral pulses otherwise.
Neuro: CN II-XII intact. Strenght [**3-23**]. Reflexes 2+ throughout.
Sensation intact.

Pertinent Results:
Pertinent laboratory results on admssion include WBC-9.3
(differential NEUTS-87, BANDS-0, LYMPHS-6*, MONOS-6, EOS-0,
BASOS-0, ATYPS-0, METAS-0, MYELOS-1*), HGB-11.1, HCT-33.7, PLT
COUNT-521. Chemistry reveals GLUCOSE-104 UREA N-14 CREAT-0.4*
SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-107 TOTAL CO2-23. Mildly
elevated alkaline phosphatase on admission at 124, transaminases
within normal limits (ALT-9, AST-15, TOT BILI-0.1). Normal
coagulation profile.

Urinalysis negative

[**2118-5-31**] CMV IgG and IgM negative


Brief Hospital Course:
His hospital course will be reviewed by problems:

1) Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: He received Ara-C and
Etoposide (day -6 to -3) and melphalan (day -2) as part of the
BEAM protocol, followed by a rest day. Reinfusion was done on
[**2118-6-24**], which was well tolerated. His period of neutropenia
extended from [**2118-6-27**] to [**2118-7-7**], at which time his ANC was
back up to 2230. He had evidence of only mild oropharyngeal
mucositis which was treated with Peridex and Nystatin.

On [**2118-7-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] had an acute transfusion reaction to
platelets, with hypotension, diffuse dermal edema and
periorbital edema, currently under investigation. He received
Solumedrol IV and Pepcid IV with symptomatic relief.
Premedication changed to Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, Benadryl 50
mg IV, Pecid 20 mg IV, Tylenol 500-650 mg PO.

2) ID: Mr [**Known lastname 45745**] had an isolated temperature spike on [**2118-6-21**]
(day -3), at which time he was started on Vancomycin and
Levoquin (latter to be started as part of the protocol on
[**2118-6-22**]). He quickly defervesced, but developed a diffuse
maculopapular rash on [**2118-6-23**], at which time Vanco was D/C'd as
it was felt to be a possible culprit. Cultures from that time
were negative. He became febrile again on [**2118-6-30**], at which
time Vanco and Cefepime were started, and Levoquin was
discontinued. He remained persistently febrile and an antifungal
was added, along with Flagyl for a history of diarrhea
(eventually C. difficile negative). His rash persisted, and
decision was taken to D/C Cefepime (query contribution to
persistent rash) and start Aztreonam. Given worsening of the
rash with periorbital edema and query contribution to the fever,
along with possibility of drug fever, all antibiotics were
stopped on [**2118-7-6**] and he received 1 dose of Solumedrol. He
defervesced for 24 hours, then his temperature rose again. He
was restarted on Flagyl and Levo on [**2118-7-9**]. Ambisome was added
on [**7-10**] secondary to a finding of pulmonary nodules on CT scan,
however pulmonary did not feel these were significant, and
ambisome was d/c'ed on [**7-16**] since the patient was not
neutopenic. His temperature reached a peak to 104.6 on [**2118-7-10**].
CT chest on [**2118-7-10**] revealed multiple small non-specific
nodules, felt by pulmonary to be non-significant. CT abdomen and
pelvis negative on [**2118-7-10**]. Aztreonam was added to the regimen
on [**7-11**]. ID was consulted, and antibiotics were changed to
Meropenem and Flagyl, and continue Acyclovir. Daptomycin was
added on [**2118-7-12**] given persistent fever and desire to broaden
gram positive coverage (Vancomycin was felt to be a potential
culprit in the rash). All cultures negative thus far except for
a single bottle positive for Corynebacterium on [**2118-6-30**] felt to
be a contaminant. An MRI of the liver done on [**2118-7-13**] was
negative for hepatic candidiasis. Stool cultures were negative.
Repeat CMV negative. He defervesced on the above regimen. His
last temperature spike was on [**7-13**]. On [**7-18**] meropenem and
flagyl were discontinued, with no further fever spikes.  He will
be discharged on acyclovir, and nystatin swish and swallow.

3) GI: On [**2118-7-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] had a Hct drop from 27 to 21 with
frankly guaiac positive stools. The source was felt most likely
to be upper GI. He was seen by GI, who was reluctant to perform
a scope given the patient's low platelets and leukopenia,
although ANC > 500. Decision was taken to treat conservatively,
with blood product support. On [**2118-7-11**], his Hct dropped again
from 29 to 21.8 with persistent melanotic stools and he was
transferred to the ICU. An EGD was performed on [**2118-7-12**], which
revealed ulceration in D3 consistent with an area of ulcerative
duodenitis without active bleeding. The EGD was otherwise normal
to D2. Pill endoscopy was considered but cancelled given a prior
history of small bowel stricture. The bleeding was also not
significant enought for a tagged RBC scan. He received a total
of 6 units PRBCs in the ICU, and 4 units of platelets. He was
transferred back to the floor on [**2118-7-14**]. His Hct has remained
stable since transfer, without further melena. Protonix IV
changed to PO BID on [**2118-7-16**], which he will be discharged on.

4) Rash: History as above in ID section. He developed a diffuse
maculopapular rash on [**2118-6-23**], which changed to a diffuse
blanching erythematous rash on [**2118-7-6**] and persisted. He also
developped some periorbital edema on [**2118-7-6**] and received a
dose of Solumedrol. Dermatology was consulted, with an
impression of erythroderma. Levoquin, Cefepime and Vancomycin
considered potential culprits and to be avoided. He was treated
symptomatically with Triamcinolone, and the rash resolved.

5) FEN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] was given TPN while he was here, in addition
to being encouraged to eat.  He will go home with TPN cycled
over 10 hours at night, and encouraged to eat a gluten free
diet.

valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Brief [**Hospital **] Hospital Course is outlined below:

1) Enterobacter bacteremia: The patient was initially admitted
to the ICU on the MUST protocol based on a lactate of 4.4. He
was mildly hypotensive and febrile to 101.4. He was aggressively
hydrated with IVF and empirically initiated on amp/gent. He was
briefly placed on levophed/vasopressin pressors but was able to
be weaned off by his second hospital day. Blood cultures from
admission grew enterobacter in [**5-15**] bottles, pan sensitive. In
addition cultures were positive for yeast, unspeciated upon
discharge. Fluconazole was added to his regimen and ampicillin
was discontinued. The source of his infection was unclear,
although urine source was suspected given dirty urine on
admission. Admission urinalysis showed >50 RBCs, >50 WBC's and
moderate leukocytes, although urine cultures were negative. The
patient was transferred to the medicine service on [**2-17**], hospital
day #3. ID was consulted and recommended a switch to levaquin
based on culture sensitivities. Flagyl was also added for
empiric GI coverage pending further evaluation. CT abdomen was
performed and demonstrated no evidence of abscess or bowel
pathology. There was mention of gallstones and gallbladder wall
thickening suspicious for cholecystitis. However the patient
remained afebrile with no abdominal pains and normal liver
function tests. Given his clinical stability with maintenance of
his blood pressure off IVF, tolerance of PO intake, and absence
of fever, he was discharged to home on [**2-19**]. He was discharged
home on PO levaquin and PO fluconazole for a 14 day course based
on ID recommendations. Flagyl was discontinued. He will
follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-12**] weeks.

2) Rheumatoid arthritis- previoiusly on plaquenil, so relatively
immunosuppressed. Granulocyte count on admission= 1680, so he
was not neutropenic. He was re-started on plaquenil after he was
clinically stable.

3) Anemia: secondary to SLE likely. Goal HCT>27. Hct remained
>30 through his hospital course. Initital decrease in hematocrit
was likely secondary to IVF hydration.

4) Edema: Noted peripheral edema following IVF hydration. He was
also noted to have bilateral pleural effusions by CT scan, also
likely secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was not
started on lasix since he was able to autodiurese well, with >2
liters off over the last 24 hours prior to discharge.

5) Mental status change: Initially delirious on admission,
likely secondary to his underlying infection. Once infection
cleared his mental status improved back to baseline. No further
evaluation was performed.

diaphoretic and, after discussion with the pt's daughter, the
decision was made to intubate him so a w/u of his fall could be
undertaken.

There was some concern about O2 sats in the low 90s, and after a
d-dimer returned at 1000, a CTPA was done. It was negative. A
head CT revealed no acute change. Hip films revealed.

He was admitted to the ICU intubated.

Date of Birth:   [**2116-6-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ACOVE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 26-year-old
woman with a history of IV drug abuse, who initially
presented to an outside hospital on [**2143-3-2**] from a
drug and detoxification facility with a chief complaint of
headache, abdominal pain, and fever.  At the outside
hospital, the patient was found to be febrile to 104.6
degrees F, and she subsequently developed hypotension with a
systolic blood pressure in the 80s.

During this initial evaluation, the patient was confused and
only intermittently answering questions.  There was concern
for possible headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia, so
given the concern for meningitis, a spinal tap was done.
This study demonstrated 50 white blood cells (84%
neutrophils), 10 red blood cells, protein of 23, glucose of
86, and 0-5 yeast per high power field.  Given these findings
and concern for meningitis, the patient received Vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and gentamicin at the outside
hospital.  Given the lack of Intensive Care Unit beds at the
outside hospital, the patient was therefore transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

On arrival to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 346**], the patient was found to have
icteric sclerae, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, abdominal
guarding, and right upper quadrant tenderness.  Given the
concern for an abdominal process, the patient was given
levofloxacin and metronidazole; she was also given Ambisome
given the finding of yeast in her CSF at the outside
hospital.

In the Emergency Department, she had an abdominal ultrasound
that was negative for the presence of gallbladder or ductal
dilatation.  Also at this time, the patient began to deny the
report that she was HIV positive; this report has been
obtained only by report and not by documented laboratory
testing from the outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Intravenous drug abuse.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Cholecystectomy.
4. Spontaneous abortion x2.
5. Therapeutic abortion x1.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a single mother of three
children ages 9, 8, and 2 years old.  She is unemployed.  She
last used heroin 3-4 days prior to admission; she began using
heroin one year prior to admission.  The patient smokes a
third of a pack of cigarettes a day and denies any history of
alcohol abuse.  She denies any history of providing sexual
favors for drugs or money.  She says her only lifetime
partner is her husband.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate
95, blood pressure 113/71, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  During this initial evaluation,
the patient was not reliable as a historian.  She appeared to
be a well dressed well-nourished female in moderate distress
from ""not feeling well"", lying in bed, and subsequently
having emesis x1.  HEENT exam:  Extraocular movements are
intact.  There was mild scleral icterus.  Mild conjunctival
edema.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
There were small conjunctival hemorrhages on the right
greater than on the left.  Her face was symmetric.  Her neck
was stiff with pain with flexion half-way down towards the
chest.  The right IJ central venous catheter was in place.  A
small posterior cervical lymph node is palpable.  Her
oropharyngeal examination was remarkable for upper dentures
with eroded mucosa and white plaques consistent with thrush
underneath.  Her tongue was coated with a whitish film, and
she had a few petechiae on her upper palate.  Her heart was
regular, rate, and rhythm, and there was a [**3-28**] holosystolic
murmur throughout the precordium that radiated to the axilla.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her
abdomen was soft, there were normoactive bowel sounds, she
had bilateral upper quadrant guarding, and mild abdominal
distention.  The patient notes that her abdominal discomfort
has been present for the past five months.  She had bilateral
upper extremity tract marks in her right forearm and in her
bilateral antecubital fossa that were clean.  Scattered dark
macules were seen on her palms bilaterally.  She had mild,
but not true CMT on pelvic examination.  She was moving all
extremities freely and equally and had full strength on
neurologic examination.

Her laboratories from the outside hospital included the
following:  Urinalysis was essentially negative.  One out of
two blood culture bottles were growing gram-positive cocci in
clusters initially.  Her CSF demonstrated 0-4 neutrophils and
0-5 yeasts per high power field, 10 red blood cells, 50 white
cells (80% neutrophils, 3% lymphocytes, 13% monocytes), 23
protein, and 86 glucose.  Her complete blood count showed a
white count of 13.3, hematocrit 35.5, and platelets 110,000.
Differential for white count demonstrated 77 neutrophils, 14%
bands, 2% lymphocytes, and 6% monocytes.  Her INR was 1.28
and her PTT was 49.  Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium
of 133, bicarbonate 21, BUN 34, creatinine 2.0.  Of note, her
creatinine was 0.5 in [**2143-1-23**].  Her total bilirubin
is 3, direct bilirubin 2.3, ALT 967, AST 396, GGT 125,
alkaline phosphatase 156; her LFTs had been normal at
baseline one month prior.

Her electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated
sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute, normal axis, and
normal intervals.

Her head CT scan from the outside hospital demonstrated
motion artifact and normal volumes to the ventricles.  An
abdominal ultrasound demonstrated increased echotexture to
the bilateral kidneys, and no evidence of hydronephrosis.

At the [**Hospital1 69**], her laboratories
demonstrated sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 113,
bicarbonate 16, BUN 26, creatinine 1.5, and glucose of 204.
Her calcium was 5.8, magnesium 1.2, and phosphate 3.  Her
white count was 12.2, hematocrit 29.7, and platelets of
60,000.  Differential of her white count demonstrated 68%
neutrophils, 19% bands, 9% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes.
Her fibrinogen was 477, FDP 10-40, and D dimer was pending.
Her ALT was 529, AST 150, alkaline phosphatase 97, amylase
46, lipase 23, and albumin 2.3.  Her urinalysis had greater
than 50 red blood cells, [**7-2**] white blood cells, and
leukocyte esterase and nitrate were negative.  Her PTT was
36.7 and her INR of 1.6.

Her abdominal ultrasound demonstrated minimal new
intrahepatic ductal dilatation and small pneumobilia.  A HIV
test was done on admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] and was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious Diseases:  While the patient was reported to be
HIV positive upon her arrival to the Emergency Department at
the [**Hospital1 69**], her HIV test
subsequently returned negative.  She also informed her
caretakers that she had multiple HIV tests in the past, all
of which had been negative.

The report of ""yeast"" found in her CSF at the OSH was also
found to be false-positive.  No yeast or fungal organisms
grew out the culture of her CSF, and a CSF Gram stain was
repeated twice at the outside hospital and found to be
negative both times.  The patient received several doses of
Ambisome at the [**Hospital1 69**], but
once it had been confirmed that the finding of yeast was a
false-positive, her Ambisome was discontinued.

By hospital day three, the gram-positive cocci in clusters
that ultimately grew out from [**2-26**] blood culture bottles at
the outside hospital had been speciated as
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  Once
this definitive speciation was made, the patient's antibiotic
regimen was tailored to include oxacillin and gentamicin; the
gentamicin was used for only four days in order to aid in the
clearance of her bacteremia.  Given the finding of this
bacteremia and her alarming concert of symptoms on admission,
a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day
two.

This study demonstrated a thickened posterior mitral leaflet
with a question of prolapse and at least mild-to-moderate
mitral regurgitation consistent with possible endocarditis.
Biventricular systolic function was preserved.  Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension was seen.  Given these findings,
a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on hospital
day three.  This study demonstrated a moderate sized mitral
valve vegetation consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial
endocarditis.

Given this finding, it was felt that all of the patient's
initial signs and symptoms were consistent with bacterial
endocarditis.  Given that the finding of yeast in the CSF was
found to be a false-positive, and given that all subsequent
Gram stain and culture data from the CSF remained negative,
the patient was not felt to have had bacterial meningitis at
any point (of note, two colonies of gram-positive cocci in
clusters were isolated from the patient's CSF culture;
however, these colonies were subsequently speciated as
coag-negative Staph, and were therefore thought to be a
contaminate.

Given the patient's LFTs abnormalities on admission, an
abdominal CT scan was done on hospital day two.  This study
demonstrated a focal area of low attenuation in the contrast
enhanced right kidney, that was ultimately attributed to a
septic embolus to the right kidney.  Also seen were large
bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis,
ascites, and free abdominal fluid, and a large amount of
pelvic fluid.  These fluid collections were all thought to be
secondary to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome
secondary to the patient's underlying bacterial endocarditis.

In order to rule out the possibility of an epidural abscess,
a spinal MRI was done on hospital day four.  This study
demonstrated no evidence of epidural abscess.  Also of note,
a MRI of the head had been done on hospital day two in order
to further evaluate for the possibility of meningeal
inflammation.  This study did not demonstrate any definite
evidence of a focal lesion in the third ventricle or a focal
mass within the brain.

Following the initiation of the appropriate antibiotic
therapy as noted above, the patient slowly began to improve
clinically.  She initially continued to spike high fevers,
but she gradually defervesced.  Her white count also
initially remained elevated, but this too gradually began to
trend down while on appropriate antibiotics.  She did develop
reactive arthridities in both her left ankle and her left
hand.  The Department of Rheumatology was consulted given
these reactive arthridities and recommended supportive care
to the area.

The patient's LFTs abnormalities present on admission
gradually normalized.  Of note, however, the patient did
develop mild elevations in her alkaline phosphatase, amylase,
and lipase following the initiation of oxacillin therapy.  It
was thought that these elevations may have been secondary to
oxacillin, but the elevations did not persist and had begun
to trend towards normal at the time of discharge.  Given
these normalizations, and given that the patient's hematocrit
had been remaining stable (thus indicating that there was no
significant myelosuppression as a result of oxacillin
therapy), the patient was discharged with a plan for six
weeks of continued oxacillin therapy.

In order to rule out the possibility of mycotic aneurysm in
the brain, a MRI of the head was obtained on hospital day
seven.  This study demonstrated no evidence of acute infarct
from septic emboli, and a subtle increased signal in the
right temporal region that could be within the sulcus.  A
similar, but less apparent abnormality was also seen along
the sulcus of the left occipital region.  These abnormalities
were nonspecific in nature, but were thought to possibly have
been due to a high protein content of the CSF.  Given the
patient's overall clinical stability, however, the decision
was made to clinically follow the patient as an outpatient
following her discharge from the hospital.

Also of note, the patient had a cervical chlamydia probe
return positive during this hospitalization.  She received
azithromycin 1,000 mg once during her hospitalization for
treatment of this chlamydia.

2. Cardiovascular:  Given that the patient had significant
endocarditis, a Cardiology consult was obtained early in the
patient's hospitalization for evaluation of whether or not
the patient was a surgical candidate for her endocarditis.
Given that the patient did not have clinically significant
congestive heart failure or valvular dysfunction with
persistent infection after 7-10 days of appropriate
antibiotics, the patient was deemed not to be a surgical
candidate.  She subsequently developed no significant
congestive heart failure, and she had no further embolic
phenomena following the septic embolus sheath to her right
kidney.

Given her bilateral pleural effusions and mitral
regurgitation, the patient was transiently on furosemide
during this hospitalization, but had no signs or symptoms of
congestive heart failure at the time of her discharge from
the hospital.

3. Rheumatology:  As noted above, the patient initially
developed a left ankle reactive arthritis on hospital day
six.  Given the asymmetric edema in her left ankle, a
Rheumatology consult was obtained.  The Rheumatology service
agreed that the swelling in her left ankle was reactive
arthritis.  The patient subsequently developed left hand
swelling later in her hospitalization, at which point the
Rheumatology service was reconsulted.  They again felt that
the swelling in the patient's left hand was due to a reactive
arthritis that would be best managed with supportive care.
She was started on a 14 day course of naproxen for treatment
of the inflammation and swelling in her hand.

By the time of discharge, the patient's swelling in both her
left hand and her left ankle had improved dramatically, and
were nearly at their baseline.

4. Hematology:  Soonafter admission, the patient manifested a
significant anemia with a hematocrit in the low 20s.  The
etiology of this anemia was ultimately thought to be
multifactorial due to a combination of anemia of chronic
disease, recurrent phlebotomy, menstruation, and oxacillin
induced myelosuppression.  There was no evidence of hemolysis
either by laboratory evaluation or by direct evaluation of
the peripheral smear.  Given that the patient's hematocrit
was low, she was started on iron supplementation during this
hospitalization.

At the time of discharge, however, the patient's hematocrit
had been consistently stable for over one week, and the
decision was made to continue her on oxacillin for the time
being with twice weekly hematocrits following her discharge
from the hospital.

5. Psychiatry:  By hospital day eight, the patient began
threatening to leave the hospital against medical advice due
to inadequate pain control.  Given the concern for the
patient possibly leaving the hospital against medical advice
without plans for continued intravenous antibiotics, a
Psychiatry consult was requested.  The Psychiatry service
felt that the patient had poor coping mechanisms given the
severity of her illness, and recommended initiation of an
atypical antipsychotic.  In addition, they recommended
analgesia as necessary, including with narcotic medications
if necessary, in order to adequately control the patient's
pain.  The patient was subsequently started on an atypical
antipsychotic, and her narcotic medication dosing regimen was
increased, with excellent therapeutic affect.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 25-year-old male
pedestrian struck by a car while walking across the street
and thrown 10 feet.  He was found unresponsive at the scene
with a GCS of 8.  He became combative in the ambulance and
was taken to [**Hospital6 5016**].  He was hemodynamically
stable.  At [**Hospital6 5016**], the patient was found to
have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on head CT along with a large
skull fracture.  He was seen by Neurosurgery at [**Hospital6 10443**] but his family requested transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**].

At the outside hospital, the patient received 2 mg of Ativan
and mannitol and a question of Dilantin for his head injury.
On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a GCS
of 14, slightly agitated, but stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Weekend use of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  GCS 14.  Alert and
oriented times one.  Vitals:  Temperature 97.2.  Heart rate
100.  Blood pressure 161/90.  Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen
saturation 100% on four liters.  Physical examination:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Face was stable.  TMs were clear.  Neck:
Trachea was midline with no crepitus.  Mandible was stable.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally with no crepitus.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended and his fast exam was negative.
Rectal was normal tone, no gross blood, guaiac was negative.
Extremities without deformities.  Patient was moving all four
extremities.  His strength was equal throughout, as well as
his sensation and nonfocal neurological exam.  There was a
small laceration noted on the right occipital area of his
head.

LABORATORIES:  Patient had a normal hematocrit of 45.0.  He
also had normal coagulations with a PT of 13, PTT of 23 and
INR of 1.2.  Laboratories were also notable for an alcohol
level of 112 and a toxicology screen that was positive for
opiates and cocaine.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray and pelvis x-ray were negative.  CT
of the abdomen was negative.  CT of the C spine was negative
for fracture.  Plain films of the TLS spine were also
negative for fracture and stability.  CT of the head showed
orbital frontal contusions with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There was extra-atrial blood noted with a question of left
epidural versus subdural hemorrhage and there was a large
associated parasagittal skull fracture running along the
midline of the cranium into the left orbital area.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for q. 1 hour neurological
checks, as well as for intravenous fluids.  The patient was
protecting his own airway, so intubation was not of concern.
The patient had an immediate consultation from Neurosurgery
who recommended that operative management would not be
necessary that it was sufficient to continue with the q. 1
hour neurological checks, as well as following the coags
every 4 hours, as well as to try to limit the amount of
sedation in order to not cloud the examination of medical
status.  The patient continued to remain agitative through
the first three hospital days requiring occasional use of
benzodiazepines and narcotics to relieve pain and agitation.

On hospital day number two, he received a repeat head CT,
which again demonstrated the parasagittal fracture, as well
as slight increase in the size of a frontal epidural
hemorrhage now with a right sided component.  While in the
Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was also
started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, as well as on
oxacillin for infectious prophylaxis of the open head wound.

On hospital day number four, the patient's mental status had
improved enough, to where his agitation had decreased
slightly allowing him to be transferred from the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit to the floor still under a 1:1 sitter due
to occasional agitation.  A Neurobehavioral consult was
obtained and per the recommendations of the Neurobehavioral
consult, the patient was removed from all sedating
medications aside from occasional Percocets for pain control
and instead was added Seroquel 25 q.p.m., as well as
trazodone 25 q.p.m. to repeat times one for helping the
patient sleep at night.

On hospital day number five, the patient was slightly
decreased in agitation in the morning, although, still
getting up out of bed and walking, even with a 1:1 sitter,
however, he continued to improve throughout the day clearing
his mental status, becoming alert and oriented times three
and becoming more aware of his surroundings.  In an attempt
to try to regulate his sleep cycles and decrease the morning
agitation, the trazodone was discontinued, but the Seroquel
was continued.  The morning of hospital day number six, the
patient showed a marked decrease in his agitation in the
morning, showing greater incite into his situation, not
getting out of bed on his own and being fully alert and
oriented.

Also, on hospital day number six, Occupational Therapy and
Physical Therapy, as well as Social Work were consulted.
Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy had helped the
patient work with his cognitive and functional deficits,
principally, his gait, which was still mostly ataxic six days
following his head injury.  Social Work was consulted
primarily for providing references for substance abuse
programs to deal with the patient's noted alcohol abuse.  The
patient continued to deny any us of opiates or cocaine,
although, did not remember if he had taken any substances the
night the injury was sustained, so the patient was referred
to substance abuse clinics for further follow-up for this.

On hospital day number six, it was determined that the
patient would be eligible for [**Hospital **] rehabilitation
inpatient therapy, so that several facilities were contact[**Name (NI) **]
and one facility determined that the patient would be
suitable for a rehabilitation stay there.  The patient was
stable enough for discharge to the rehabilitation facility
under constant 1:1 supervision to decrease any fall risk.
Thus, the patient was discharged to a neurological
rehabilitation facility on hospital day number six.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pedestrian struck by car.
2.  Parasagittal skull fracture.
3.  Frontal lobe contusions.
4.  Bilateral epidural hemorrhages with result in cognitive
and functional disabilities.
5.  Substance abuse.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dulcolax 5 mg 2 tablets q.d. as needed for constipation.
2.  Tylenol 650 mg q. 4-6 hours as needed for pain.
3.  Hydromorphone 10 mg, 1-2 tablets every 4 hours as needed
for pain.
4.  Seroquel 25 mg, 1 tablet q.p.m. times four weeks.
5.  Dicloxacillin 500 mg, 1 capsule po q. 6 hours times eight
days.

FOLLOW-UP:
1.  The patient will be followed up at the Rehabilitation
Facility by a physician to take out the staples and evaluate
the head wound in seven to ten days.
2.  Neurosurgery follow-up in three weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**]
with a repeat CT prior to the appointment.
3.  Trauma Clinic in two weeks.
4.  Neurobehavioral follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 51572**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one
month.
5.  Alcohol and other substance abuse.  Patient was provided
referrals for follow-up at each of these places.

ADDENDUM:  Over the final weekend prior to discharge, the
patient reported difficulty with vision as well as with smell
and taste.

For the visual difficulties, the patient said that
occasionally he had double vision but mostly his vision was
just blurry in the right eye, but with closing the right his
vision would improve.  He said this also partly effected the
way that he was walking and that his walking was better with
the right eye closed.

For the new reported visual changes, on physical examination,
showed a slight decrease in the later movement ability of the
right eye; consistent with a sixth nerve palsy.  The visual
fields were intact, however.

Given these new findings, a repeat head computed tomography
was ordered which showed no interval changes.  No effects of
the area in or around the orbit but still showing the
bilateral epidural hemorrhages and frontal edema.

Regarding the difficulties in smell and taste, over the
course of the weekend the patient did notice an improving
anosmia; which, per the behavioral neurologist, was
considered likely to improve over time.  For the anosmia,
which decreased the patient's appetite, they were
supplementing his diet with Boost drinks three times per day.

The patient had been on fluid restriction during her
hospitalization to reduce cerebral edema; as ordered by
Neurosurgery.  This restriction was safely discontinued prior
to his discharge to the rehabilitation facility.

The patient was re-evaluated for neurologic rehabilitation
centers after being rejected on the original day of discharge
and was approved by [**Hospital3 6841**] Clinic in [**Location (un) 5905**] for discharge to an inpatient setting on [**2132-8-20**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  No changes made to medications on
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to the
[**Hospital3 6841**] Clinic.

Service:  General Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 11907**] is a 70-year-old
gentleman who, in the past, had multiple abdominal surgeries.
As a consequence of his surgeries, he had developed very
large hernias along his midline incision and at the site of
his previous stoma in the left lower quadrant.  He presented
to the office comlaining of post-prandial pain at his incisional
hernias. At that time, he had elected to undergo a ventral hernia
repair which was performed laparoscopically on [**2155-2-18**].

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  He experienced some
nausea with abdominal distention which eventually resolved.
He was discharged uneventfully to the Transitional Care Unit
[**2155-2-22**], he was tolerating a regular diet and
passing flatus.  Two days after his discharge, he developed a
fever up to 101.9??????, chills, nausea but with no vomiting
with mild left upper quadrant and abdominal pain.  Pn
evaluation, he had an elevated white count of 13,000 and his
abdomen was very distended and tender on examination.  A KUB
revealed a very large collection with an air fluid level in the
mid abdomen.  A follow up CT scan confirmed free intraperitoneal
air and a large collection that appeared to be below the [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex
mesh that was placed on the previous surgery.  With the
possibility of a bowel injury and perforation, the patient
was readmitted to the [**Hospital6 256**]
and he was taken back to the Operating Room for an
exploratory laparotomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post subtotal gastrectomy.
2.  Status post colectomy and colostomy for an unknown
etiology.
3.  Status post colostomy takedown.
4.  Multiple incisional hernias, status post laparoscopic
repair as stated above.
5.  Status post a stroke with residual poor memory and
confusion.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hypothyroidism.
8.  History of depression.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levoxyl 0.112 mg po q day.
2.  Norvasc 5 mg po q day.
3.  Wellbutrin SR 250 mg po q day.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
5.  Dulcolax.
6.  Milk of Magnesia.
7.  Percocet prn.
8.  Multivitamins.
9.  Tylenol.
10. Senokot.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no history of alcohol
consumption.  He lives at home alone with daily assistance
from caregivers.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient was a 70-year-old male, mildly confused
in moderate distress.  He appeared mildly uncomfortable.
VITAL SIGNS:  He had a temperature of 100.6??????, heart rate of
91, blood pressure 130/72, respiratory rate 18 with an O2
saturation of 96% on room air.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Distended, tympanitic with protrusion of hernias.
Diffusely tender to palpation and light touch, but
nevertheless, the patient remained with a soft abdomen.   All
hernia sites were reducible.  There was no erythema, no
drainage.
RECTAL (as per the TCU):  Soft stool, low impaction, guaiac
positive.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, negative edema, hyperpigmented skin.

SIGNIFICANT LABS:  White count of 13,000, hematocrit of 30.5,
platelet count of 328.  Differential showed 74% neutrophils,
5% basophils, 9% lymphocytes.  The urinalysis was negative.
Urine culture was negative.  Electrolytes:  Sodium 135,
potassium 3.9, chloride 99, CO2 26, BUN 26 with a creatinine
of 1.3 which was the patient's baseline and a glucose of 148.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2155-2-25**] at 7:30 p.m. Mr.
[**Known lastname 11907**] was taken back to the Operating Room.  He underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with oversewing of a left colonic
perforation, excision of the [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex mesh, evacuation of a
hematoma and placement of three [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
under stable condition to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
for close monitoring.  Overnight, he remained hemodynamically
stable and he was weaned successfully and uneventfully off
the ventilator.  He was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime
and Flagyl for broad antibiotic coverage.

By postoperative day #2, the patient was doing well.  He was
spiking mild fevers to 100.6??????, but vital signs were stable.
His abdomen remained soft, slightly tender to palpation,
moderately distended.  His white count came down to 8.8 with
a hematocrit of 27.5 and a platelet count of 220.  His
electrolytes were within normal limits.  His pain was well
controlled on morphine and he was kept NPO with a nasogastric
tube suction.  Anticipating that the patient was going to be
nutritionally deprived, TPN was started that same day.

By postoperative day #3, the patient continued on vancomycin,
ceftazidime and Flagyl.  His vital signs were stable.  His
temperature started to trend down.  He was not complaining of
significant pain and his nasogastric tube was discontinued.  The
patient remained on the TPN.  The wound that was left open for
closure was being packed with wet-to-dry gauzes and the dressings
were changed [**Hospital1 **].  There was no evidence of infection or drainage
and there was good granulating tissue.

By postoperative day #6, Mr. [**Known lastname 111359**] foley was discontinued and
his diet was advanced to clear liquids. On postoperative day #7,
he was tolerating clears well and his diet was advanced to
regular diet as tolerated.  A physical therapy consult was
made and the patient was able to ambulate with the assistance
of the physical therapist.  Two of his JP drains were
discontinued and only one was left in place.  His po
medications were restarted.  Nutritional service was
encouraging the patient to take his po supplements tid.

On postoperative day #8, his antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
His abdomen was soft, mildly distended and still tender to
palpation.  His wound was then packed [**Hospital1 **] and had good
granulation tissue and no infection or drainage.  The JP #3
was discontinued later that afternoon.

By postoperative day #9, Mr. [**Known lastname 11907**] was screened by the TCU
and he was found to be stable to be transferred to this
facility to continue his recovery.  His temperature at that
time was 98.9??????, blood pressure 110/60, heart rate of 60,
respiratory rate of 20, 97% O2 saturation on room air with
good urine output and his finger blood sugars below 190
currently on TPN.  The patient was advanced to a regular diet
and nutrition service was keeping a calorie count on him.
According to the last calorie count, his intake was less than
300 calories, so it was decided to keep him on TPN.  Today,
[**2155-3-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 11907**] is being transferred to the
Transitional Care Unit to continue his recovery.

He is being transferred on these medications:
1.  Levoxyl 0.112 mg po q day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
3.  Wellbutrin 250 mg po q day.
4.  Colace 100 mg po bid.
5.  Norvasc 7.5 mg po q day.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Exploratory laparotomy and repair of descending colon
perforation, status post laparoscopic LOA and ventral hernia
repair with mesh placement.

Imaging:
[**2173-12-28**]: ECHO - Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with evere
global hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus is seen. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
wall hypokinesis. The aortic leaflets are normal with good
excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a small to moderate sized circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-12-17**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (specifically around
the right atrium). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is higher, right ventricular free
wall motion may be slightly worse, and the severities of mitral
and aortic regurgitation are slightly increased.
.
[**2173-12-27**]: portable abdominal film - No dilated loops of large or
small bowel are seen to indicate obstruction.  No definite free
intraperitoneal air is seen.  There are bilateral pleural
effusions with lower lobe airspace opacities.
.
[**2173-12-24**]: CT a/p - 1. New, bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. Ground-glass opacities at the left lung base
may represent fluid overload. 2. Cardiomegaly with interval
marked enlargement of the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] from the previous CT.
Moderate pericardial effusion. 3. Diffuse bowel wall thickening
involving the right colon to a greater extent than the left.
These findings may represent infectious colitis or possibly
typhlitis. 4. Anasarca.
.
[**2173-12-21**]: KUB - Non-specific bowel gas pattern. No air-fluid
levels to suggest obstruction.
.
[**12-18**]: CXR - 1. Stable cardiomegaly. 2. Improvement of the
perihilar opacities with residual opacities at the bases. This
may be secondary to resolving pulmonary edema or infectious
process.
.
[**12-17**]: ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. LVEF <= 20%.
.
[**12-17**]: CXR - Successful placement of 39 cm total length double
lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for
use.
.
[**12-16**]: portable CXR - 1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette suggesting
cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion, which has increased
compared to the prior examination. 2. Bilateral perihilar
opacities, likely due to pulmonary edema, increased compared to
the prior examination. Superimposed infection including PCP
cannot be excluded.
.
[**12-15**]: CXR - Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette suggesting
cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion that has progressed
compared to [**2173-8-13**]. Nonspecific bibasilar opacity suggests
edema or consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# PNEUMONIA: It was felt that Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] had a pneumonia on
admission. With her history of disseminated MAC and PCP in the
past, she was treated empirically for community-acquired
pneumonia (with 10 days of levaquin), MAC (with clarithromycin
and ethambutol), and PCP (with atovaquone originally, then
clindamycin and primaquine due to nausea and vomiting associated
with the atovaquone). ID was consulted and helped guide her
management throughout her hospital course. She was hypothermic
and hypotensive on admission, which raised concerns for sepsis,
but her BP responded to fluid boluses and her temperature came
up slightly. Induced sputum x3 was sent and were negative for
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB culture came back positive for AFB on [**1-3**] (AFB
smears were negative x3). Identification of the organism is
still pending, but after confirming this with ID, it was felt
that this was most likely MAC and the patient was being
adequately treated with her current azithromycin dose (1200mg PO
1x/week).
.
# HIV: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] was not taking her HAART medications or her
prophylaxis upon admission, so her HAART regimen was suspended
until her acute pneumonia was treated and a discussion could be
had between the patient and her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] team was concerned that
many of her comorbidities, principally her cardiomyopathy and
her renal failure, were related to her HIV and would only
improve or remain stable with the administration of HAART. Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] met with Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] on 11R and it was decided to
restart antiretrovirals, with a 5 drug salvage regimen which ID
recommended based on her resistance profile. They also helped
make recommendations for her prophylaxis, so her ethambutol and
clarithromycin were changed to azithromycin 1x/week and her
clindamycin and primaquine were changed to Bactrim. She refused
to take atovaquone because of nausea and vomiting. Because of
her history of a Bactrim allergy, she was brought to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for Bactrim desensitization. Once she had begun prophylaxis and
tolerated the regimen well, she was restarted on a HAART regimen
which included zidovudine, tipranavir, ritonavir, tenofovir, and
lamivudine. She tolerated that regimen well with no change in
her symptoms (diarrhea, abd pain were unchanged) and she was
discharged on this regimen. Prior to discharge, social work
contact[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3912**] of the [**Name (NI) 392**]/[**Hospital3 **] AIDS Cares
Network at [**Hospital6 10353**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 31475**]) to set up
outpatient services for Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**].
.
# CARDIOMYOPATHY: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] was tachycardic and hypotensive in
the ER, with SBPs in the 60s. A BNP was checked in the ER and
was 32,538. Her SBP responded well to fluid boluses and came up
to the 90s. Her tachycardia persisted, however, EKGs showed it
was a sinus tachycardia. On the floor, she was monitored on
telemetry and she developed a HR of 170s overnight. She was
given PO and IV diltiazem which dropped her SBP and her HR to
the 70s. She was asymptomatic during this episode, but was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring. An ECHO showed
that her EF was < or =20% and she had severely depressed left
ventricular systolic function and mild global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. Her SBP came back up to the 90s in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and she was felt to be hemodynamically stable, so she was
transferred out the floor. Her volume status remained difficult
to assess as she appeared to be both total body overloaded (was
grossly edematous, with bilateral LE edema) and intravascularly
dry (no appreciable JVD, hypotensive, tachycardic, with acute on
chronic renal failure and oliguria). Renal was consulted and
after analyzing her urine sediment, felt that her picture was
most consistent with prerenal azotemia (on top of underlying HIV
nephropathy) and recommended IVF to correct her prerenal state.
She was given multiple liters of IVF with minimal improvement in
her UOP, BP and tachycardia. She become more volume overloaded
so she was given transfusions of pRBC (as her Hct was also in
the low to mid 20s), again with minimal improvement. Her Cr
remained elevated and her UOP remained poor. She was tested for
adrenal insufficiency given her persistently low BP, but she was
not adrenally insufficient by cosyntropin stimulation test. A
repeat ECHO was performed which again showed an EF of < or =
20%, dilated left and right ventricles, and moderate-severe
global hypokinesis bilaterally. There was no tamponade
physiology. Cardiology was informally consulted to see if there
would be utility to placing a line to measure CVP and then
perhaps diuresing her (likely with the addition of a pressor),
but it was felt that less invasive measures would be best in
this patient. She was restarted on digoxin (no loading dose) and
tolerated it well. Her digoxin level prior to discharge was
still subtherapeutic, but because of her renal function, it was
decided to keep her on this dose and recheck a dig level as an
outpatient. She was given metoprolol 12.5mg PO x1 to attempt to
slow down her HR, but dropped her SBP to the 70s. Her BP
responded to IVF boluses, but it was decided to not try any
further medications that could potentially drop her BP. She was
not able to be started on lasix, an ACE or spironolactone for
this reason. She was monitored on telemetry after starting the
digoxin and had one run of NSVT (13 beats).
.
# ARF: On admission, her Cr was 2.8 which appeared to be an
acute on chronic renal failure. Her urine lytes were consistent
with prerenal physiology and she was hydrated with IVF but with
only minimal improvement in her UOP. She maintained UOP of
15cc/hr for most of her hospital stay. Based on her urine
studies, it was felt that she was prerenal and needed IVF. She
was also given bicitra to attempt to correct the acidosis that
was developing from her renal failure. However, the more IVF we
gave, the more she seemed to third space and she developed
anasarca and lower extremity edema which was very troublesome to
her. Her BP was so low that we were never able to safely give
lasix to see if her UOP and edema would improve. With
administration of digoxin, her Cr began to improve and came back
down to her baseline of 2.1 by the time of discharge. She still
had significant proteinuria (spot Prot/Cr of 5510, dipstick
protein of 500) which was attributed to HIV nephropathy. Her
HAART regimen was dosed according to her discharge Cr, so her Cr
will have to be monitored closely as an outpatient and her
medications will need to be adjusted according to her CrCl.
.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: Her abdominal pain became a more
prominent symptom once she developed anasarca. Multiple stool
studies were sent as she had frequent diarrhea, but all
cultures, including O+P and Cdiff, were negative. A CT scan of
her abdomen showed a question of typhlitis. KUB were negative
for free air or for obstruction/toxic megacolon. Ms. [**Known lastname 31476**]
abdominal pain seemed to wax and wane, but became less severe
once she began to autodiurese and her bloating and abdominal
distension resolved. Her greater concern was diarrhea. She felt
that each time she stood up, she had to have a bowel movement
and sometimes she would be incontinent because she could not
control the urge to defecate. All stool studies were negative,
including Cdiff toxin B. She was given loperamide to help
improve her diarrhea, which worked with some success. She was
given a prescription for this upon discharge, with instructions
to follow up on this symptom with her ID doctors as it could be
related to her medications (possibly the azithromycin or maybe
even her HAART regimen).
.
# ANEMIA: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] is anemic, with her baseline Hct in the mid
20s. She is asymptomatic from her anemia, but was given several
transfusions during her hospital stay in an attempt to increase
her BP and intravascular volume without causing third spacing.
However, her BP was minimally responsive to transfusions so they
were held unless she became symptomatic. Stools were guaiac
negative. Labs were most consistent with an anemia of chronic
disease. On discharge, her Hct was 24.5.
.
# FEN: IVF were given originally, but had to be held due to
anasarca. Her electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted
as necessary. Her K and HCO3 were often low and needed
repletion. Her Na also trended down, and she was briefly put on
a 1.5L/day fluid restriction to help bring her Na back to
normal. She was given a regular, low salt, heart healthy diet.
She was continued on Megace, though she frequently refused this
medication.
.
# PPX: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] was given heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis, but
she soon developed thrombocytopenia and it had to be stopped.
HIT antibodies were never sent. She was then given [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings
and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis. She was given a bowel
regimen originally, but by the end of her stay, she was having
frequent diarrhea and no stool softeners were needed. She was
also given a PPI for GI ppx.
.
# Access: She had a peripheral line originally, then a PICC line
was placed in her L arm due to poor IV access. The PICC line
worked well for her throughout her admission, without any
evidence of infection or cellulitis.
.
# Code: FULL. A discussion was had with the patient about her
code status and the patient did not seem to understand what it
meant to code someone or what it would mean for her as the
patient. It was decided, however, that she would be CPR not
indicated in case an event were to occur.
.
# Dispo: To home with services.

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Clozaril Overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 36F h/o ""schizophrenia"" admitted for clozapine overdose.
Per report of her psychiatrist (per ED note) pt's mother was
treating her daughter at home for schizophrenia. She kept her
locked in the house during the days while she was at work
believing that the pt may be denied a Green Card upon receiving
the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Starting in [**Name (NI) 1096**], pt began
to express her desire to end her life, so mother sought medical
attention. On day of admission pt was found at home on the
floor, unconscious in a pool of vomit, surrounded by 5 empty
bottles of clozapine (100 25mg tabs per bottle). EMS was called,
pt was thrashing, incoherent and agitated. Taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where she was intubated for airway protection.

In ED received Ativan 2 mg IV, activated charcoal,
succ/etomidate and 3L NS. Propofol gtt was ineffective in
sedating her so pt was paralyzed with vecuronium, thinking that
her lactate may improve if twitching stopped. Her lactate did
not improve and vecuronium d/c'd.

Past Medical History:
""Schizophrenia"" symptoms started 10 yrs ago, worse over past
year, with SI since [**Name (NI) 1096**]
Mother reports that patient had ""unknown"" brain surgery for her
schizophrenia in [**Country 651**].

Social History:
Pt is a Chinese citizen. She has an associate degree and speaks
English. She lives with mother [**Name (NI) 1255**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60311**] who is
giving her psych meds from [**Country 651**] to prevent documentation of
diagnosis. Pt's psychiatrist's pager is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60312**].

Date of Birth:   [**2113-5-22**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chief complaint is status post acute
myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation
at rest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Ms. [**Known lastname 18647**] is a 57-year-old
woman with no prior history of coronary artery disease;
however, with a remote 15-pack-per year history of tobacco
use and a family history positive for coronary artery disease
who was in her usual state of health until two days prior to
admission.

At that time, the patient noticed intermittent epigastric
discomfort and multiple episodes of chest pressure throughout
the day.  Each episode lasted between 7 minutes and 15
minutes and occurred both with exertion and at rest.

On the morning of admission, the patient had one episode of
chest pressure and left-sided neck pain which lasted
approximately 15 minutes.  This pain resolved spontaneously.
The patient was then well until 7 p.m. on the day of
admission; at which point she noticed increasing chest
pressure which prompted her to go to the Emergency Department
at an outside hospital.

En route to the Emergency Department, she developed worsening
substernal chest pain without any radiation.  However, this
was associated with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and the
feeling of doom.

In the Emergency Department, she developed further chest
pain.  An electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in V2
through V6, and also in leads I and aVL, with ST depressions
in leads II, III, and aVF.  The patient was given aspirin and
Retavase 10 mg intravenously times one; at which point, she
had ventricular fibrillation at rest.  The patient was
shocked once at 200 joules and then 300 joules; after which
she returned to a normal sinus rhythm.  The patient became
chest pain free after Retavase.  The ST segment elevations
returned to baseline.  The patient was then started on
heparin, Integrilin, and amiodarone and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] Coronary Care Unit for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy for endometrial cancer 30 years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q.d. (for
one and a half years) and Citracal.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nursery teacher.  She lives with
her husband, her daughter, and her daughter's husband and
child.  She has four children.  She has a remote history of
tobacco use; 15-pack-per year history.  She quit in [**2144**].
She denies any cocaine, heroin, or intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a myocardial infarction at
the age of 55 to 60.  Her brother had a myocardial infarction
at the age of 59.  They are both status post coronary artery
bypass graft.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on arrival
revealed temperature was 97.6, heart rate was 99, in a normal
sinus rhythm, blood pressure was 102/64, respiratory rate was
26, oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters.  General
appearance revealed a middle-aged woman in no acute distress;
moderately anxious, chest pain free.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx with bleeding.  The neck
revealed jugular venous pressure approximately 10 cm of
water.  No bruits.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No
gallops and no murmurs.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with active bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm
and obese.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable bilaterally.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 12.7, hematocrit was 41,
and platelets were 417.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 141,
potassium was 3.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 23,
blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 0.9, and blood
glucose was 113.  AST was 16, ALT was 12, albumin was 3.4.
Creatine kinase was 82.  Troponin was 0.15 at the outside
hospital (where less than 0.2 is considered normal).  PT was
10.6, INR was 0.8, PTT was 24.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  First electrocardiogram revealed a normal
sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63, ST elevations in V2
through V6 in leads I and aVL.  ST depressions in leads II,
III, and aVF.

Second electrocardiogram, status post Retavase revealed a
normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 64 with premature
ventricular contractions.  Still with ST depressions in leads
III and aVF with resolution of ST elevations in leads V2
through V6, I, and aVL.

Third electrocardiogram, status post ventricular fibrillation
arrest and cardioversion, revealed a normal sinus rhythm with
a heart rate of 87.  Complete resolution of ST depressions in
aVF and lead III and complete resolution of all ST elevations
in leads V2 through V6, I, and aVL.

Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 69**]
upon arrival revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate
of 82, good R wave progression.  No Q waves.  No ST
elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 18647**] is a 57-year-old woman who
presented status post anterolateral myocardial infarction;
successfully treated with thrombolytics.

Ms. [**Known lastname 18647**] was continued on a heparin drip and Integrilin drip
from admission until Monday, [**2170-12-24**] when she went
to cardiac catheterization.  During this time she was
consistently chest pain free.

The cardiac catheterization showed single vessel disease with
90% stenosis at the origin of the left anterior descending
artery.  The proximal left anterior descending artery lesion
was stented with good flow.  An echocardiogram showed severe
focal hypokinesis of the anterolateral septum with an
ejection fraction of 51%.

After cardiac catheterization, she received Integrilin
infusion for another 18 hours.  She was then loaded on
Plavix, and she was continued on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.  Her
peak creatine kinase was 270.  A fasting cholesterol panel
was obtained which showed  total cholesterol of 239,
low-density lipoprotein of 140, and high-density lipoprotein
of 61.  Therefore, she was started on atorvastatin 10 mg p.o.
q.d.  Premarin was stopped.

Her heart rate remained in a normal sinus rhythm with a rate
ranging between 80 to 105.  She was started on Lopressor
which was titrated up as tolerated; up to 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
which was then converted to Toprol-XL at discharge for
patient convenience.  However, her heart rate continued to be
slightly elevated; ranging between the 80s and 90s.
Therefore, a thyroid-stimulating hormone was obtained to rule
out hypothyroidism.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Aborted anterolateral myocardial
infarction.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (for one month).
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with cardiac rehabilitation
in [**Location (un) **].
2.  The patient was also to follow up with her primary care
physician within the next two weeks.
3.  To follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if her insurance permits this
within the next one month.

[**2147-4-5**] ECHO
PRE-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Insufficient time to measure MV or AO valve gradient/area before
beginning CPB. LVOT = 1.8. Annulus = 2.2.

Post-CPB: Well seated and functioning aortic valve prosthesis.
No leak, no AI. Other parameters remain as pre-bypass. Intact
aorta. Good biventricular
systolic function.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-4-5**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
utilizing a 21mm pericardial valve. Postoperatively she was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit. On
postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. She was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step
down unit for further recovery. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. Her pacing wires and drains were removed per protocol
without incident. On postoperative day five, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had a
fever spike. She was pan cultured and empirically started on
ciprofloxacin.Her urine culture was positive for E.Coli and
ciprofloxacin was continued. She complained of numbness of her
right lateral thigh which improved slowly. It was presumed that
this was related to a right lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
neuropathy likely from positioning. Mrs [**Known lastname **] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day
six. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist
and her primary care physician as an outpatient.

Service:  CCU/MEDICINE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13143**] is a
45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and gout who
was in his usual state of health until 2:00 a.m. on the day
of admission.  At that time, the patient was awakened by
associated with diaphoresis.  The pain resolved spontaneously
after ten minutes but then recurred 20 minutes later, [**7-31**] in
intensity and again associated with diaphoresis.  It was also
associated this time with dizziness and the pain was
radiating into his sternal area.  There was no associated
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.

the Emergency Department by his wife who is a nurse
practitioner. He was taken via ambulance.  His pain at that
time was [**1-1**] after two sublingual nitroglycerin.  At the
outside hospital, the patient was found to have ST
depressions in leads II, III, and aVF and he was hypertensive
with a blood pressure of 200/110.  He was given sublingual
nitroglycerin, heparin drip, and beta blocked and
subsequently experienced a witnessed V-fib arrest and
required shocking with 200 joules.

He returned to sinus bradycardia and then a normal sinus
rhythm.  He was started on a lidocaine drip and then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Cath lab for persistent
discomfort/chest pain.

At cardiac catheterization, the patient had the following
hemodynamics.  Cardiac output was 5.24 with a cardiac index
of 2.48.  The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was elevated
at 26 and his right atrial pressure was 13.  On angiography
he had a left dominant system with luminal irregularities in
the LAD, 30% stenosis of the left circumflex, and the
patient's ramus was completely occluded.  The ramus was
Angio-Jetted and then stented with restoration of TIMI-III
flow.

The patient was then transferred to the CCU.  On review of
systems in the CCU, the patient denied chest pain, shortness
of breath.  On review of systems, he states that he was
noticing minimal bilateral lower extremity edema prior to
admission but denied dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, PND, or
palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE CCU:  Vitals:  Temperature 98,
blood pressure 127/56, pulse 82, saturation 96% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter in
place.  In general, the patient was lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  He was speaking in full sentences.
HEENT:  The pupils were equal, reactive, and round to light
and accommodation.  The oropharynx was clear and dry.  He was
anicteric.  The neck was supple.  No bruits.  JVP could not
be adequately assessed.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
anteriorly and laterally.  His abdominal examination revealed
a soft abdomen, nontender, nondistended, no masses.  Arterial
and venous sheaths were in place in the right groin without
hematoma or ooze.  His pulses were full times four, warm and
well perfuse.  The neurological examination was grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA AND OTHER STUDIES:  The patient's EKG in the
CCU was normal sinus at 93, axis within normal limits,
intervals within normal limits.  His EKG showed right atrial
enlargement and T wave flattening in leads F and aVL.

He had a hematocrit of 39.7, white count 15.7, hemoglobin
13.3, platelet count 271,000.  Chemistries revealed a sodium
of 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  His magnesium was 1.5.  His
first CK was 1506 with an MB of 232.  Prior CKs at the
outside hospital included a CK of 169 with an MB of 2.2 and a
troponin of 0.15.

Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed clear lung fields
and no cardiomegaly.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gout.
2.  Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia; at last
check total cholesterol 278 with a triglyceride level of
1,000.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral knee menisci repair.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Lipitor 20 q.d.
2.  Tums p.r.n.
3.  Indocin p.r.n. for gout.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works in IT for [**Company **].
He is married and lives with his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **] is a
nonsmoker.  He does not use intravenous drugs.  He drinks
6-12 beers per week.

FAMILY HISTORY:
1.  Mother with MI at age 42.
2.  Father with CVA at age 68.  The patient's father also
suffered from gout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIAC:  From a cardiac standpoint, the patient is
status post his first MI which was in the ramus
distribution.  He also had symptoms of CHF with elevated
wedge pressures and left-sided pressures.  The patient was
placed on metoprolol, Captopril, and was given Lasix 20 mg IV
times one to mobilize the fluid from his elevated pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure.

The patient was also placed on aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Status post stenting of the ramus, he was placed on Plavix 75
q.d. which to be continued for nine months status post
stenting.  The patient's CK peaked at 1,711 on the evening of
[**2164-11-18**] and then on [**2164-11-19**] his CK was 1380, on [**2164-11-20**],
the day of discharge, his CK had fallen to 409.

The patient's cholesterol panel came back with a total
cholesterol of 209, HDL 42, calculated LDL of 90 and a
triglyceride level of 386 with a cholesterol to HDL ratio of
5.  Realizing that these levels are not accurate during an
acute event, the patient was continued on his outpatient
regimen of Lipitor 20 q.d. and was told to follow-up with his
outpatient cardiologist for remeasurement of the cholesterol
panel and appropriate adjustment of his Lipitor dosage.

The patient's LFTs were also checked on [**2164-11-20**] as he was
being continued on a statin.  His ALT was slightly elevated
at 73.  His AST was essentially within normal limits at 48,
alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were normal at 94
and 0.7 respectively.  The patient was old to follow-up with his
primary cardiologist regarding appropriate dosage of the statin.

RHYTHM:  From a rhythm standpoint, the patient was status
post V-fib arrest in the setting of an MI.  He was placed on
telemetry and monitored closely for recurrent episodes of
V-tach.  He had one episode on [**2164-11-19**] of a 14-beat run of
V-tach that was asymptomatic.  His electrolytes were within
normal limits including his magnesium which had been repleted
and was 2.2 at the time of the arrhythmia.  The patient was
kept on telemetry through [**2164-11-20**] and had no recurrent
episodes of V-tach or nonsustained V-tach or PVCs for that
matter.

The patient had an echocardiogram to help risk stratify  him.
His echocardiogram showed a normal EF of 55%.  The left
atrium had a normal size.  The left ventricle had normal wall
thickness.  Cavity size and systolic function was within
normal limits with no noted wall motion abnormalities.  His
right atrium was normal size as well as his right ventricle.
His valves were all stated to be structurally normal.  He had
mild mitral annular calcification with trivial MR.

It was felt that the patient would not require an EP study
with this normal EF and with no recurrence of the ventricular
arrhythmia.  The patient had originally been on a lidocaine
drip and this was discontinued 24 hours after his event.

PUMP FUNCTION:  As stated, above this was completely normal
on his echocardiogram with an EF of 55%.

CARDIAC FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was to see his primary care
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days after discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at
[**Hospital3 1196**].  His primary care physician will
refer him to a cardiologist at [**Hospital1 **].

Of note, the patient's wife is a nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] and is very involved in the patient's care.
She has already arranged for the patient to follow-up in
cardiac rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was
advised to take a week off from work and attend cardiac
rehabilitation.

He was seen by physical therapy during his stay and was able
to walk two flight of stairs without chest pain or shortness
of breath.

2.  RHEUMATOLOGY:  The patient has a history of gout and did
have a gouty flare of the arch of his right foot on the
evening of [**2164-11-19**].  He was initially given Percocet for
pain management as it was felt that Indocin should be avoided
in the setting of acute MI.  However, with the patient's
normal EF and absence of ventricular scarring, his risks for
wall rupture was extremely low.  Therefore, the patient was
told that he could have a trial of colchicine and if this did
not work he could resume his outpatient medication of
Indocin.

He was started on colchicine on the day of discharge, given a
trial dose of 0.5 mg p.o. and would be discharged on the
following medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
3.  Atorvostatin 20 mg q.h.s.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
6.  Colchicine 0.5 to 1 mg q.i.d. for a maximum of 8 mg q.d.,
titrate to pain relief or development of side effects,
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  These instructions were gone
over thoroughly with the patient.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with his
wife.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old HIV
positive African-American male with a history of
polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hypertension
who was admitted to [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital on [**2177-2-10**], for
detox following a recent binge using crack cocaine (about one
gram per day), alcohol (one pint of wine per day) and Xanax
and Klonopin while on Methadone maintenance.  On [**2177-2-12**], he was noted to have fluctuating mental status
(somnolence, disorientation) and after being found down
beside his bed confused, with a bloody nose and a blood
pressure of 170/130, he was presumed to have had a seizure.
He was given 1 mg of Ativan and was brought to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department.
Following a negative head CT, no further seizures and stable
vital signs, the patient was discharged back to Bornwood on
an Ativan taper.  On [**2177-2-13**], the patient was reported
to be lethargic and ataxic, with a blood pressure of 150/100.
EMT brought the patient back to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where his vital signs included a
blood pressure of 190/90, pulse of 88 and a respiratory rate
of 4, satting 94% on room air.  The patient was barely
responsive to sternal rub, with constricted pupils and was
started on Narcan, receiving a dose of 0.06 mg/hour with good
effect.  He was admitted to the MICU in the early a.m. on
[**2177-2-14**].  It was difficult to obtain additional history
from the patient at this time.  Subsequently it was learned
that the patient received some OxyContin 40 mg from a friend
while at detox, and remembers taking it prior to admission to
the hospital, although he is unclear as to what day he took
it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV positive since [**2162-3-12**].  A CD4 count of 78 with an
undetectable viral load was noted in [**2176-9-10**] as per the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**].  The
patient has a history of thrush as per previous dictation
summaries.  There is a question of a history of PCP in the
past.  The patient was on HAART, but this was discontinued in
the fall of last year because of decompensating liver disease
in the setting of hepatitis C.
2.  Multisubstance abuse including intravenous drug abuse.
The patient has a long-standing history of multisubstance
abuse going back 25 years that includes intravenous heroin
and cocaine abuse, benzodiazepine use including Xanax and
Klonopin, and ethanol.  The patient has been in and out of
rehabilitation facilities in the past, stays on long term
Methadone maintenance.  While the patient does admit to
recent use of cocaine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, he
denies use of heroin for several months, stating that he does
not crave heroin while he is on Methadone.
3.  Hepatitis C positive.  The patient has active hepatitis C
disease with a high viral load and is not a candidate for
therapy at this time considering his current treatment for
depression.  His albumin has been as low as 2.5 in the past
but has improved since holding HAART therapy.  He has no
history of ascites or gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
falls between Child Class B and C cirrhosis.
4.  Pan cytopenia likely secondary to HIV and ethanol abuse.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.
7.  History of tuberculosis exposure.
8.  History of bacterial endocarditis, Staph positive in the
past ([**2161**] and [**2168**] hospitalizations).
9.  History of sternoclavicular septic arthritis in [**2167**].
10. Status post motor vehicle accident with head trauma.
11. Bilateral leg pain and numbness secondary to peripheral
neuropathy.
12. Status post appendectomy.
13. Status post inguinal hernia repair.
14. Question of a distant history of seizure.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg q. day.
3.  Ativan 1 mg t.i.d. taper.
4.  Thiamine.
5.  Folate.
6.  Clonidine 0.2 t.i.d. p.r.n.
7.  Motrin 400 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
8.  Mylanta 30 cc q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Ativan 1 mg p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Location (un) 686**] and has five children and several grandchildren.
He is retired since [**2172**] after working for American Airlines
as a ramp worker.  He now lives on SSI with Mass Health and
Veterans benefits that cover his medications.  As previously
mentioned, he has an extensive history of intravenous drug
abuse that includes intravenous heroin and cocaine abuse that
extends back for decades.  His recent binge was attributed to
increased depression of recent time because of his inability
to stay clean, his cirrhosis and chronic illnesses, a recent
fight with his wife, multiple deaths in the family, and an
upcoming court date next week for a DUI that he was arrested
for in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.  The patient has a one pack per
day smoking history and, while he denies extensive abuse of
alcohol, he does admit to recently drinking one pint or one
bottle of wine per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergy to Bactrim that causes
him to have a rash.  The patient has an allergy to nafcillin
which has also given him exfoliative dermatitis of the palms
and soles in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is healthy at age 83.
The patient's father is 82 years old, suffering from diabetes
mellitus.  The patient has two sisters who have died of
cancer, one at the age of 58 and one who passed away in her
20's.  There is no family history of substance abuse.  There
is a question of a history of depression in the patient's
mother.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At admission the patient denied
complaints of headache, chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.  He had no complaints of
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain at the time.  No
dysuria or increased urinary frequency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination at presentation to the Intensive Care Unit floor
the patient had the following vital signs:  He was afebrile
with a heart rate of 75, blood pressure of 139/101, a
respiratory rate of 18 and he was saturating 100% on room
air.  General appearance:  The patient was very somnolent,
but responsive to questions and without tremulousness.  On
examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the
patient was normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucus membranes were
dry.  Pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light bilaterally.
The patient's neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  On
pulmonary examination the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.  On cardiovascular
examination, there was a normal rate and rhythm with normal
S1, S2.  A systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex.  On
abdominal examination normal bowel sounds were present.  The
abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended.  The
extremities were without edema or cyanosis.  On neurological
examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No focal motor
deficits were appreciated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
the following laboratories on admission:  A complete blood
count revealed a white blood cell count of 1.9 with an ANC of
700, hematocrit of 32.5 and a platelet count of 53,000.
Chem-7 (hemolyzed) showed a sodium of 137, potassium of 4.8,
chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 31, BUN of 13, creatinine of
0.8 and a glucose of 118.  A serum tox screen for aspirin,
ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, TCA
was negative.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES AT ADMISSION:
1.  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm, with left ventricular
hypertrophy and left atrial abnormality.  Nonspecific ST
changes were observed.  Q2 prolongation that is new on this
EKG was observed compared with previous [**2170-12-16**] EKG.
2.  Chest x-ray:  Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement with
prominent left ventricle contour.  Wide thoracic aorta.  No
evidence of pulmonary congestion or infiltrates.
3.  Head CT:  Head CT from [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit
showed mild focal dilatation, with a normal ventricular
system.  No midline shift, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage was
observed.  Chronic paranasal sinus disease was noted.

IMPRESSION AT ADMISSION:  This is a 45-year-old
African-American male with a history of polysubstance abuse,
HIV and hepatitis C who came to the Emergency Department with
stuporous mental status changes from detox facility.  This
was felt to be most likely from an opiate overdose, as the
patient appeared to respond to Narcan while in the Emergency
Department.  Infection as a possible etiology for mental
status changes could not be completely ruled out in this HIV
positive patient with his last CD4 count of 78.  However, the
patient does recall taking an extra 40 mg of OxyContin prior
to admission on top of his maintenance Methadone dose of 55
mg per day and benzodiazepine taper that he had been started
on after his [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit, making
overdose more likely.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Neurological:  Patient's mental status changes which
included increased lethargy to stuporousness, pinpoint pupils
and decreased respiratory rate in the setting of Methadone,
benzodiazepine and opiate use make opiate overdose the most
likely cause of this patient's presentation.  The patient
showed good response to naloxone throughout his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit which was continued as a drip until [**2177-2-15**], with dramatic improvement in the patient's state of
alertness.  Other causes for his change in mental status
included withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol,
electrolyte abnormalities, infection, intracranial processes,
as well as renal hepatic disease.  For that reason,
electrolytes were followed, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
levels were sent.  An LP was also performed.  The patient was
pan cultured, including cultures for blood, urine and
cerebrospinal fluid.  Because of the patient's history of
alcohol and benzodiazepine use with the last alcohol use
likely on [**2177-2-10**], there was a possibility of
withdrawal in this patient, so a CIWA protocol with diazepam
q. 4h. for a score greater than 10.  Clonidine p.r.n. was
also continued for the possibility of developing opiate
withdrawal.  In this patient with depression, his Prozac was
held while he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  A Neurology
consult felt that the seizure on [**2177-2-12**], was most
likely secondary to a combination of withdrawal from both
alcohol and benzodiazepines.  As recent cocaine was evident
in the urine tox screen, there was some concern of a cerebral
infarct, but a negative CT and nonfocal neuro examination
made this less likely.  Liver function tests and ammonia were
also sent in this patient with a history of hepatitis C.

Patient's laboratory values while in the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2177-2-14**], included a calcium of 8.0, magnesium of 1.4
and a phosphate of 3.1.  The patient's PT was 13.7, INR was
1.2 and PTT was 37.7.  The patient had an elevated AST of
101, an ALT of 52, an alkaline phosphatase of 129, and a
total bilirubin of 0.8.  His albumin was 2.7 and was repeated
that same day and found to be 3.1.  Amylase was 98 and lipase
was 63.  The patient had an ammonia elevated to 95 with no
history of previous baseline ammonia recorded in the past.  A
urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and Methadone and
negative for benzodiazepines.  An LP was performed on [**2177-2-14**], which showed 0 white blood cells, 6 red blood cells,
a protein of 37, and a glucose of 57.  The Gram stain was
negative for PMNs, no microorganisms were seen.  Cryptococcal
antigen was not detected, and fluid, acid fast, viral, and
fungal cultures were sent.

2.  Infectious Disease:  This patient is HIV positive and
hepatitis C positive, and it is possible that infection could
also be an underlying cause of his mental status changes.  As
mentioned he was pan cultured, including blood, urine, CSF
and stool cultures.  Tests for CD4 count and viral load were
sent.  The patient reported that he has not been on
retrovirals since the fall of last year.  Liver function
tests were ordered to follow up the status of his cirrhosis,
and were elevated as previously mentioned in this dictation.
Throughout the patient's duration in the Intensive Care Unit,
he did not complain of fevers, shortness of breath or
productive cough, dysuria, or other complaints suggestive of
infectious process.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's respiratory rate improved on
Narcan drip while in the Intensive Care Unit and there was no
need to intubate.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of hypertension and
has used beta blockers in the past.  He has not been on his
hypertensive medication during the past several days while at
detox.  His pressures remained elevated while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  In the evening of [**2177-2-14**], he was
hypertensive to 206 and was given a dose of hydralazine for
control of his pressure.  Subsequently, lisinopril 5 mg q.
day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day were begun to better
control his pressure.  The patient's EKG showed an increased
QT prolongation from prior EKG, in the setting of a potassium
of 3.4 upon repeat Chem-7 on [**2177-2-14**].  It was unclear
that any of the other medicines that the patient were taking
should be associated with causing this QT prolongation.  The
patient's potassium was repleted.

5.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was noted on
CBC.  This was stable throughout his stay in the Intensive
Care Unit.

6.  Renal/Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient
was given maintenance fluids of one-half normal saline 100 cc
per hour.  These were maintained until the patient's mental
status improved.  He began tolerating p.o.'s on [**2177-2-15**].  Because of the patient's elevated ammonia, he was
placed on a low protein diet once he was able to tolerate
p.o.'s.  Electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted
as necessary, with potassium and magnesium requiring
repletion.  The patient was placed on thiamine, folate and a
multivitamin considering the patient's history of alcohol
abuse.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of cirrhosis
in the setting of HAART use that was discontinued in [**2176-9-10**] with a history of ethanol abuse.  He has had elevated
transaminases, PT and albumin of 3.1 and elevated ammonia.
Lactulose was started at 30 cc t.i.d., titrated to less than
two stools per day to treat the elevated ammonia.  Hepatitis
C serologies were not sent at this time and will likely be
followed as an outpatient.

8.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was placed on subcu heparin and
Pepcid IV q. day.

SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient's mental
status continued to improve on Narcan drip which was weaned
over 12 hours to a respiratory rate greater than 11.
Cultures remained negative during the ICU stay.  The patient
was able to tolerate p.o.'s prior to transfer.  Vital signs
were stable, although his blood pressures remained elevated
prior to transfer.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**] [**Company 191**] Service on [**2177-2-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE FLOOR ([**2177-2-15**] to [**2177-2-17**]):
1.  Neurological:  On arrival to the floor, the patient was
breathing comfortably in no acute distress and was alert and
oriented with some depressed mood.  He did complain of some
symptoms of nausea, chills, diaphoresis, aches and pains,
diarrhea, that he thought were consistent with his typical
withdrawal symptoms.  He was continued on the CIWA protocol
with p.r.n. diazepam, and clonidine was continued for his
complaints of opiate withdrawal.  His Methadone was begun on
the floor at a dose of 55 mg q. day.  Lactulose was also
considered in light of his elevated ammonia, although
encephalopathy appeared to be unlikely in this patient with
no asterixis or additional changes in mental status.  We
continued to follow daily labs which showed a white blood
cell count of 1.7, hematocrit of 32.6 and a platelet count of
47,000, with an ANC of 740.  Electrolytes showed a sodium of
137, potassium 3.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 22, BUN 8,
creatinine 0.5 and glucose 98.  Calcium was 7.5, magnesium
1.8 and phosphate was 3.0.  While the PT and INR were now
normal, PTT remained slightly elevated at 39.  The patient
was offered a nicotine patch for his nicotine addiction which
he declined.  The patient's mental status continued to be
stable during his stay on the floor, with no signs of overt
anxiety, hallucinations, instability, but the patient was
somewhat depressed and nervous, which he admitted was
primarily due to his worry about personal stressors.  His
symptoms of opiate withdrawal were also negligible during his
second and third days on the floor.  Prozac was restarted on
his last day of admission for depression.  It appeared that
the patient had very few symptoms of ethanol withdrawal,
however, his blood pressure did remain elevated throughout
his stay but without tachycardia.  The patient's symptoms of
opiate withdrawal seemed to be well controlled on his
Methadone maintenance dose although the patient did receive
one to two doses of benzodiazepine per day, and requested
clonidine on his final day of admission p.r.n.  However, the
patient does admit that he feels better than he has in years
physically but admits that it is psychological problems and
depression that make him feel most concerned at this time.
We had several discussions with the patient regarding the
seriousness of this hospital admission and the risk of poor
outcome if he continues such risky behaviors, as this
overdose might have been life threatening.  The patient is
actually quite thoughtful and clearly depressed with his
current health situation, living environment (""my
neighborhood is full of drugs""), and life stressors (several
deaths in the recent past in his family).

2.  Infectious Disease.  The patient's CD4 count was found to
be 48 during this admission and his viral load is still
pending.  The patient remained afebrile throughout his
admission, without complaints of fever, productive cough,
dysuria, abdominal pain, or other clinical signs concerning
for infection.  Blood, stool and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
have been negative to date.  Prophylaxis was begun for PCP
with dapsone and fluconazole was also started in this patient
with a history of thrush.  However, fluconazole was
discontinued prior to __________ as prophylaxis is not
indicated routinely in HIV positive patients.  As the
patient's CD4 count is below 50, toxoplasmosis titers were
also sent, and should be followed up for possible
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis as well as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an
outpatient.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient's EKG was repeated on [**2177-2-16**], and was found to be unchanged from admission EKG,
with suddenly prolonged QT interval.  Potassium was also 3.2
on [**2177-2-16**], and was repleted.  The patient's blood
pressure continued to be elevated throughout his stay on the
floor, in the 150's to 180's over 90's to 100's.  The dose of
lisinopril was increased to 10 q. day, and it was decided
prior to discharge to change the patient's blood pressure
regimen to 10 mg lisinopril b.i.d., to discontinue the
hydrochlorothiazide, and to begin Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was breathing comfortably with
normal respiratory rate and saturating well on room air
throughout his stay on the floor.  While the patient
complained of some runny nose on transfer to the floor, he
developed no other symptoms suggestive of a serious
respiratory infection.  This patient does have previous
hospitalizations because of pneumonia with a question of PCP
pneumonia in the past.

5.  Renal.  The patient had normal creatinine throughout his
hospital stay.  His urinalysis was negative except for a
negative urobilinogen in this patient with advanced liver
disease.  Urine culture was positive for group B Strep which
was an endogenous organism not considered needing to be
treated.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient's lytes
were followed and were repleted while he was on the floor.
Potassium remained slightly low throughout and was repleted
with 40 mEq of KCl during each of his stays on the floor and
was increased to 60 mEq on [**2-17**].  He was maintained on a
low protein diet in light of his elevated ammonia which was
up to 148 on his day of discharge.  He was continued on
thiamine, folate and multivitamin and additional B12 and
folate studies were sent and are still pending.  He tolerated
p.o. liquids and solids well throughout his stay on the
floor.  No complaints of nausea or vomiting.

7.  Gastrointestinal.  In this patient with hepatitis C
positive cirrhosis his albumin came back at 2.8 on [**2177-2-16**].  We continued to follow an ammonia which was 148 prior
to discharge, and lactulose was poorly tolerated by the
patient and was discontinued on his final day of admission.
The patient was requesting therapy options for his liver
disease and seemed most concern with this of his health
issues.  Unfortunately, Interferon therapy may be
contraindicated in this patient on Zoloft with clear symptoms
of depression.  As an outpatient it would be recommended that
he receive vaccination such as hepatitis A in light of his
liver disease.  While this patient has no prior history of
gastrointestinal bleed, we began Imdur for GI prophylaxis,
and it is recommended that he have an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an outpatient.

8.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was stable while
on the floor.  The patient did complain of a nose bleed one
morning in the setting of low platelet count that he
described as robust, but which stopped easily and did not
recur.  In light of the patient's pan cytopenia which may be
likely due to ethanol use, HIV, liver disease, it was thought
that B12 and folate should also be checked.

9.  Prophylaxis.  The patient remained on heparin subcu
b.i.d. and ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. throughout his stay
on the floor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition at
discharge.  He was not complaining of symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal, and was maintained on CIWA protocol greater than
8 during his last three days on the floor.  Methadone
maintenance was restarted with good effect.  He was primarily
concerned with psychosocial issues of maintaining sobriety, a
safe drug-free environment, his chronic health issues, family
stressors, and tomorrow's pending court appearance.
Depression, for these reasons, is a concern in this patient
who appears to have overdosed on narcotics leading to this
admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to
[**Hospital 10073**] Hospital, where he was first admitted last Monday
([**2177-2-10**]) to begin a detox program prior to this
hospitalization.  He wishes to return to Bornwood to continue
his detox in a safe environment where he can try to address
his recurrent urges for polydrug abuse.  [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital is
located at [**Street Address(2) 10074**] in [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 10075**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Thiamine 100 mg q. day.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
3.  Multivitamin.
4.  Dapsone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
6.  Fluoxetine 20 mg q. day.
7.  _____ 10 mg b.i.d.
8.  Ativan 1 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Clonidine 0.2 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.
10. Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
11. Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Imdur 30 mg q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient was instructed to call his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**], after discharge to set up a
follow-up appointment in one week if he desired to continue
having her involved in his care.
2.  As the patient mentioned a desire to transfer his care
from the V.A. Hospital, as he has had some negative
experiences there in the past, we have set up an appointment
for him with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Associates, [**Hospital1 1444**], for this Thursday, [**2-20**], at 2:00 p.m., the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  At this
appointment the patient will be able to follow up his pending
laboratory studies which include pending cultures, his viral
load, his toxoplasmosis cultures.  Also potassium and ammonia
levels should be checked at this time.  As the patient's
blood pressures have been elevated during his hospital stay
and his blood pressure control medications are still being
optimized, his blood pressure should be checked during this
visit and modification of his medical regimen should be
considered.  Pending results of the toxoplasmosis titers, the
patient should be considered for a toxo and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
considering his CD4 count of 48.  Also consider a hepatitis A
vaccine and confirm hepatitis B status in this patient.  As
this patient was noted to have a slightly prolonged QT
interval on EKG, it would also be useful to recheck an EKG
during this visit.  While this patient has had no complaints
of gastrointestinal bleed in the past, he should be sent for
endoscopy to look for varices as an outpatient.  The patient
has also been requesting psychiatric and/or social work
support as he has numerous psychosocial stressors and needs a
support network to help him with his depression and with the
numerous issues involving his drug abuse and health care
problems.  This patient should also be set up to be followed
in the [**Hospital3 **].
3.  The patient was also scheduled to visit the Pain Clinic
at [**Hospital1 69**] this Thursday with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-20**] at 12:40 p.m.  This visit is
important in light of his chronic back pain and peripheral
neuropathy, which the patient states have been a factor in
his persistent drug use.
4.  Continue with Methadone maintenance program as previous
to admission.
5.  Consider contacting [**Name (NI) 10076**] for acupuncture treatments as
the patient has requested this therapy which has worked for
him in the past.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Opioid and benzodiazepine intoxication.
2.  Polysubstance abuse.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Intracerebral hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72539**] is an 85 year old right-handed man with a history of
hypertension (per his wife it is not severe) and cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (stable for 17 years), who is transferred from
[**Hospital **] Hospital with the diagnosis of left intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  Per his wife he had not recently been ill and was
feeling quite well this morning, without complaint of headache,
visual changes, or new trouble with his balance.  He has chronic
low back pain and had an appointment with his chiropractor this
morning.  He told his wife he was going to work out after that,
and left the house at about 11 a.m.  The chiropractor then
called his wife, saying that he looked rather shaky.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 72539**] then apparently left the office and sat in the driver's
seat of his car, with the door open.  Someone noticed that he
did not look well and called EMS.
They found him with right face/arm/leg weakness and slurred
speech.  His blood glucose was 91 and BP was 168/98.  He was
brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital where his initial BP was 151/72 and
his HR was 57.  He was afebrile.  There he was described as
having no speech output but he was following commands.  He was
not coagulopathic, with an INR of 0.95, PTT of 29.9, and
platelets of 322.  He had a head CT which revealed a small
(about 3 x 2.5 cm) hemorrhage in the left external capsule, with
no midline shift and no intraventricular blood.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

Upon arrival here his blood pressure was elevated at 188/77 and
he was given hydralazine.  He was taken for head CT, and per
recommendation of Neurosurgery, CTA (presumably to look for
dissection, although per his wife he gets no neck manipulation).

Review of systems:  No recent fever, weight loss, cough,
rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,
vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.  No complaints of headache,
diplopia, dysarthria, tinnitus, vertigo, dysphagia, weakness,
numbness, or paresthesias prior to this event.

Past Medical History:
- Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72540**] at BU;
diagnosed in [**2174**], s/p treatment with ""photopheresis"" and
currently maintained on a medication called ""Targretin""
- Hypertension - per his wife they have never been told that it
is severe
- S/p ""tongue cancer"" ?leukoplakia
- Chronic back pain


Social History:
Lives with his wife.


Family History:
Father deceased from MI in his late 70's.  No stroke that his
wife knows of.


Physical Exam:
(initially examined while lying flat awaiting CT, then later
seen while sitting up, when much more awake)
T  Afebrile   HR 54  BP 140/63   RR 18  Pulse Ox 98% on 2L NC
General appearance:  Sleepy 85 year old man in NAD
HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple
CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops. No
carotid or vertebral bruits.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended
Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema

Mental Status: (when lying flat) Somnolent.  No spontaneous eye
opening, briefly opens eyes to sternal rub but requires repeated
stimulation.  Mute.  Does not repeat, does not follow commands.
Does not mimic movements.  Decreased attention to the right side
of space.

(when sitting up about 30 minutes later) Awake, eyes
spontaneously open and looking around the room (prefers left),
still mute, does not repeat or follow commands, does not mimic,
but seems to recognize wife and son-in-law, and they thinks he
understands a little bit of what they say.

Cranial Nerves: Pupils are pinpoint and non-reactive. Does not
blink to threat with either eye (but based on visual attention
likely has right homonymous hemianopia).  Optic disc margins
could not be visualized. Gaze is midline and conjugate, when
sleepy could doll to either direction. There is no nystagmus. +
corneals, +grimace to nasal tickle bilaterally. Right UMN facial
weakness. Tongue is midline.  Weak gag.

Motor System: Exam somewhat limited due to global aphasia and
initially, somnolence.  Normal muscle bulk. Flaccid on right
side. Spontaneously moves left arm and leg antigravity.
Extensor postures right arm to noxious stimuli, and makes no
movement with right leg, which is held externally rotated.

Reflexes: Deep tendon reflexes are trace on the left, absent on
the right.  Plantar responses are flexor on the left, extensor
on the right.  No [**Doctor Last Name 937**].

Sensory: Withdraws to noxious stimuli with left arm and leg,
grimaces and extends right arm, does not respond to noxious in
right leg.

Coordination, Gait:  Could not assess.

Head CT/CTA [**1-9**]: FINDINGS: There is a large 4.1 x 7.8 cm
intraparenchymal hematoma in the left basal ganglia,frontal and
temporal lobes with intraventricular extension. There is midline
shift of approximately 8.8 mm with effacement of the ipsilateral
ventricle. There is mild trapping of the contralateral
ventricle. There are confluent hypodensities in the
periventricular and subcortical white matter compatible with
small vessel ischemia in a patient of this age group. There is a
prominent right frontal extra-axial space. There are secretions
in the right maxillary sinus.
Evaluation of the CTA of the brain demonstrates no aneurysm or
hemodynamically significant stenosis. There is calcification of
the cavernous carotid arteries bilaterally. There is mild
stenosis of the left PCA.
Evaluation of the CTA of the neck demonstrates calcified
atheromatous plaquing at the origin of the right distal common
carotid artery and bulb extending to the proximal ICA. There is
approximately 50% stenosis of the distal common carotid
artery/carotid bulb and mild stenosis of the proximal ICA which
does not appear to be hemodynamically significant.
There is a focal calcific plaque at the origin of the right
vertebral artery which is occluded.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large left intraparenchymal hematoma in the left basal
ganglia and frontal and temporal lobes.
2. No underlying lesion noted on the CTA.
3. Approximately 50% stenosis of the right carotid bulb
extending to the proximal ICA with a calcified plaque.
4. Occlusion of the right vertebral artery with a calcific
plaque at the origin.

Head CT [**1-10**]: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large evolving 7.4 x 3.8
cm left intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the left basal
ganglia. There is surrounding edema which causes moderate mass
effect. There is compression of the left lateral ventricle and
entrapping of the right lateral ventricle. Ventricular size has
not changed compared to the prior study. A small amount of blood
is seen layering the right atrium and a moderate amount of blood
is seen layering the left atrium. Again seen is 9 mm rightward
subfalcine shift. The osseous structures are unchanged. There is
mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving left intraparenchymal hematoma centered at the left
basal ganglia with surrounding edema resulting in a 9-mm of
rightward subfalcine herniation and mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle.
2. Moderate amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. The size of
the ventricles has not changed compared to prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old man with history of hypertension, now with left
external capsule hemorrhage, which had more than doubled in size
in the past 4 hours, although he had no evidence of
coagulopathy.  He had significant involvement of most of the
left hemisphere, blood in the left lateral ventricle, midline
shift and right subfalcine herniation.  The etiology of the
hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive, although the location
was a bit unusual (would expect basal ganglia or thalamus), but
another spike in his blood pressure may have been responsible
for the expansion of the bleed.  The subcortical location would
not be typical for amyloid angiopathy.  Clinically, on initial
exam, he was fairly awake, although he was globally aphasic and
had a dense right hemiparesis.  He was at significant risk for
deterioration of his mental status, especially given the
subfalcine herniation.  His prognosis for meaningful recovery,
i.e. without major disability, was poor.

We discussed this at length with Mr. [**Known lastname 72542**] wife and
son-in-law.  [**Name (NI) **] had expressed to his family quite clearly that
he did not wish to be kept alive on a long-term basis by
artificial means, did not want any heroic measures, and would
not want to live with major disability.  Neurosurgery had spoken
with the family about the possibility of an EVD, but Mrs.
[**Known lastname 72539**] felt that he would not want to have any surgical
intervention.  She expressed that initially he could be
intubated if his mental status were to decline, but if the
intubation were to become prolonged, they would reconsider
whether they wanted to keep the tube in.  They did not want him
to be resuscitated (i.e. no CPR, shocks, meds) if his heart were
to stop beating.

Neuro: Patient was admitted to Neurology ICU where serial
neurochecks were performed.  Mannitol 50g IV was given initially
in the ED and then continued 25mg every 6 hours thereafter with
parameters to hold subsequent doses for Na >150 or Osm >320.  He
was loaded with 1g Dilantin which was subsequently discontinued
upon re-evaluation in the am since his bleed was subcortical and
risk of seizure was low.  Head of bed elevated greater than 30
degrees and kept euthermic and euglycemic.  Repeat head CT the
following morning showed an evolving left intraparenchymal
hematoma centered at the left basal ganglia with surrounding
edema resulting in a 9-mm of rightward subfalcine herniation and
mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.  There was also a
moderate amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. The size of the
ventricles had not changed compared to prior study.  Clinically,
patient was more somnolent with less spontaneous movement.
Meeting was again held with the family regarding his clinical
status and family made decision to make patient do not
resuscitate and do not reintubate.  The following morning the
patient's family made him comfort measures only and he was
called out of the surgical intensive care unit to the floor.  He
was subsequently discharged to hospice care.

CV: Ruled out myocardial infarction.  EKG notable for first
degree AV block and sinus bradycardia without priors for
comparison.  Continued cardiac telemetry while in ICU. Goal SBP
< 160, MAP < 130 and gave metoprolol standing and hydralazine as
needed.  Continued lipitor 10mg QD.

PULM: Patient did not require intubation.

FEN: Patient was kept nothing per mouth as aspiration precaution
and family declined nasogastric tube feedings.  His serum sodium
downtrended to 127 and he was fluid restrict and treated with
hypertonic 3% saline at a slow rate with good result.

Service:  C MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female
with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
status post CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 20%,
status post left parietal CVA, and bilateral carotid aortic
stenosis, status post left CEA, who was transferred from an
outside hospital for right carotid artery stenting.

At the outside hospital, the patient was treated for CHF
exacerbation with successful diuresis.  Her hospital course
at that time was complicated by nausea, vomiting, with
elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT status post right upper
quadrant ultrasound without evidence of stones or ductal
dilatation with trace ascites.  GI was consulted with
assessment of CHF versus possible gastritis.

A second complication included right MTP ulcers, status post
debridement.  No evidence of osteomyelitis.  This was treated
with Keflex for a ten day course.

The next issue included acute on chronic renal failure with
creatinine peak at 2.8, BUN 71.  Renal consult for this felt
that it was believed to be due to worsened CHF.

On presentation, the patient reported minimal shortness of
breath with significant fatigue and weakness.  She denied
chest pain, abdominal pain, orthopnea, PND, or fever and
chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent for chronic nausea for weeks
with intermittent vomiting.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  She has a prior
tobacco history of 40 plus years for one to two packs per
day, quit a month ago.  Denied ethanol or illicit drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.0, BP 142/56, heart rate 50, respiratory rate 22, SP02 93%
on 2 liters.  General:  The patient was in no acute distress,
a pleasant female who appeared chronically ill.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Surgical left pupil.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Clear oropharynx.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, positive JVP.  Pulmonary:
Decreased breath sounds one-fourth of the way up on the
right.  No wheeze.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
with S3 and a II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Abdomen:  Soft, obese, bowel sounds positive,
positive hepatomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema.  The right
MTP revealed a shallow-based ulcer, 1+ DP pulses on the
right.  The left MTP showed a healing ulcer, 1+ DP pulses on
the left.  Neurological:  The patient was awake, alert, and
oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  The
patient was noted to be diffusely weak, right upper extremity
[**5-12**], deltoid, biceps, triceps, sensation diminished to light
and pinprick, stocking glove distribution.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at 52 beats per minute with leftward axis.  There
were T wave inversions in the anterolateral leads and [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression also in the anterolateral leads which were
unchanged from [**2142-3-21**].

The admission laboratories were pertinent for a hematocrit of
32.4.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.6, chloride 87, bicarbonate
40, BUN 60, creatinine 2.6, glucose 69.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  She
continued diuresis until her baseline weight.  The day after
admission, the patient underwent stenting and PTA of the
right ICA with good results.

Post procedure, the patient had a hematocrit drop and was
given 1 unit of packed red blood cells to return to greater
than 30.  Also, postoperatively, the patient had episodes of
bradycardia to the 40s.  This was due to the procedure being
near the carotid body.  She was asymptomatic when this rate
drops.  Also of note, the patient's creatinine increased to
3.4.

The patient appeared intravascularly depleted and she was
given IV fluid hydration.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right internal carotid artery stenosis, status post
stent.
2.  Chronic renal failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with VNA
Services.  Of note, the patient refused rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

Pertinent Results:
[**2162-3-2**] CNIS: On the right, peak velocities are 65, 60, and 53
cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent
with no stenosis. On the left, peak velocities are 50, 71, and
40 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is
consistent with no stenosis.
[**2162-3-2**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated a two vessel CAD. The LMCA
was patent. The LAD had a 70% proximal and a 90% mid vessel
stenoses. The LCx was patent but there was an 80% stenosis in
the OM1. The RCA had mild nonflow limiting disease. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 8 mm Hg and a mean PCWP of 10 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.33 l/min/m2. 3. Left
ventriculography was deferred. 4. There was a severe aortic
stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 45.89 mm Hg and a
calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62 cm2. 5. Peripheral angiography
demonstrated no right iliac disease. 6. Short run of SVT during
the case that terminated spontaneously.
[**2162-3-3**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is normal in size.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. 4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The sino-tubular junction is preserved. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic
valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed and extremely calcified. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace to Mild (1+)mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: Pt
is being atrially paced and is on an infusion of phenylephrine
1. AV bioprosthesis well seated in good position. No significant
perivalvular gradient. Trace central valvular AI is noted, no
perivalvular leak seen. Aortic graft noted in ascending aorta.
2. No wall motion abn noted, maintained LV and RV function 3.
Aortic contours unchanged 4. Remaining exam unchanged
[**2162-3-4**] UE U/S: Grayscale and Doppler images of the left IJ,

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 35501**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath on
[**2162-3-2**]. Cardiac cath revealed severe aortic stenosis along with
2 vessel coronary artery disease and a dilated ascending aorta.
He was then referred for surgical evaluation. [**Date Range **] all
pre-operative testing and was brought to the operating room on
[**2162-3-3**]. He [**Date Range 1834**] an Aortic Valve Replacement, Asc. Aorta
Replacement, and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2. Please see
operative report for surgical details. He did have significant
amount of post-op bleeding that required multiple blood
products. Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition.  Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one there appeared to be left arm edema with
bluish discoloration and left-sided neck bulge. All left arm
peripheral IV's and arterial line were removed, vascular surgery
was consulted and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT. His chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Diuretics and
beta-blockers were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards
his pre-op weight. On post-op day two he was transferred to the
telemetry floor. He continued to improve post-operatively and
worked with PT for strength and mobility. Left arm swelling and
neck bulge has resolved.  Clinically he appeared to be doing
well but needed additional PT and was discharged to rehab
facility on post-op day seven.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**4-6**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A primum atrial septal
defect is present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POST CPB: A prosthetic
patch is visualized on the IAS, at the position of the primum
defect with no residual shunt on CFD. An annuloplasty ring is
seen in the mitral annular position, which is well seated and
mecahnically stable. Peak gradient across the mitral valve = 16
mm. Hg. Mean gradient 7 mm Hg. Mitral valve area by continuity
equation was consistently obtained to be 2-2.4 sq.cms. Mitral
valve area by planimetry of the mitral leaflets was 3 sq. cms.
Preserved bivertricular systolic function.
CXR [**4-9**]: 1. Decreasing right apical pneumothorax. 2. Worsening
bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis, although
differential includes aspiration and infectious pneumonia.

for surgery following out-patient pre-operative work-up. She was
brought to the operating room on [**4-6**] where she underwent a
repair of her mitral valve and closure of a ASD y Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Please see operative report for surgical details. She was
then transferred to the CSRU on minimal BP support for invasive
monitoring. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day tow her
chest tubes were removed and she was weaned off Neo-Synephrine.
She was then transferred to the cardiac surgery step down floor.
Both beta blockers and diuretics were started and she was gently
diuresed towards her pre-operative weight. Both Vitamin C and
Iron were started secondary to patient being anemic (although
asymptomatic so wasn't transfused). Epicardial pacing wires were
removed on post-op day three. Physical therapy followed patient
during post-op course for strength and mobility. She continued
to improved post-operative with stable labs, vital signs and
physical exam on day of discharge. She was discharged home on
post-op day 4 with VNA services and the appropriated follow-up
appointments.

Service:  TRAUMA SX

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 23-year-old
gentleman who was in his usual state of health when in the
early on the day of admission was reportedly stabbed in the
chest.  It is unknown the actual sequence of events.  It is
reported that the patient had been stabbed, entered his
vehicle, began to drive and subsequently crashed into some
parked cars.  Patient was taken from his car and brought to
the [**Hospital1 69**] with initial heart
rate in the 90s, blood pressure in the 90s and saturation of
98%.

The patient, upon entering the Trauma Room, had a heart rate
of 78, blood pressure of 98/66, respiratory rate of 24 and
saturating at 100% on room air. The patient underwent a DPO
which was negative and VATS exam which showed a pericardial
effusion.  He was resuscitated with four liters of lactated
ringers and a unit of blood in the Trauma Room.  The patient
was then moved to the Operating Room for emergent exploration
of the wound.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is an information technology worker
at a computer firm at [**Hospital1 8**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Head and neck are within normal
limits.  Chest had bilateral breath sounds.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  He had positive extremity pulses.
Patient had a 3 cm stab wound of the fifth intercostal space
on the left.

LABORATORY:  On admission white count was 9.8, hematocrit
36.6, platelets 161,000.  PT was 14.5, PTT 28.5, INR 1.5.
Urinalysis was negative.  Sodium 145, potassium 3.6, chloride
112, bicarbonate 19, BUN 10, creatinine 0.9.  Glucose 151.
Amylase 54, calcium 7.4, magnesium 1.5, phosphorus 2.4.

ETOH was 245.  Other tox screen was negative.

Arterial blood gas drawn once he was intubated initially was
7.33, 37, 205, 20.

Chest x-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and slight
widening of mediastinum.  A subsequent head CT Scan was
negative.  Subsequent C spine CT Scan was negative for
injury.  CT Scan of the abdomen was also negative.  AP pelvis
was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon being transferred to the Operating
Room for emergent exploration, the patient lost blood
pressure and in the Operating Room underwent an emergent
thoracotomy and exploration.  Injury to the right ventricle
was found and repaired.  The patient was resuscitated
successfully and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
in stable conditions on no pressors.  Patient's postoperative
course is as follows.

In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was weaned and
extubated on postoperative day #1 without any incident.  The
patient had a postoperative echo which was within normal
limits.  Postoperative day #2, the patient was transferred to
the floor for the remainder of his recovery.  The patient had
a right chest tube discontinued and his diet was advanced.

He was evaluated by Physical Therapy and began to ambulate.

On postoperative day #3 the patient had a temperature spike
to 102.7 F.  Blood cultures were sent which have only been
only significant for one bottle out of four with staph
coagulase negative.  He was started on Vancomycin.  He
subsequently defervesced.  His white count went to a high of
10.6 and more recently is 7.7.  The left chest tubes were
discontinued without incident.  The wound was examined.  It
has been clean, dry and intact.  The patient had a second
echo was [**2111-9-1**] for evaluation of the valves which showed
no vegetations.

On postoperative #5 his antibiotics were discontinued.  The
patient was ambulating, tolerating diet and is now stable and
ready to go home.

Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. endotracheal intubation
2. central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o M w/past hx of HTN and cervical radiculopathy, who
presented today c/o weakness. He stated that he thought he had
the flu over the past few days, with a nonproductive cough,
headache, and general weakness. Very poor PO intake. He was
recently prescribed effexor, and took his first dose this AM.
Approximately one hour after that, he felt much weaker. EMS was
called and on arrival his bp was 80/60. He received 1 L NS and
his bp responded to 120s.

On arrival to the ED, his bp was 110s-120s/60s with a pulse in
the 60s. He was awake, alert, and answering questions. His only
complaints were of a headache, and he felt like he had to
urinate but was unable to. He denied any chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain. Mild nausea but no vomiting. While
examining him, he became bradycardic to 42 and hypotensive to
60/40. He was febrile to 101.2 and diaphoretic. He received 2L
NS wide open with a mild response in his bp to 70s/50s. He was
put on peripheral dopamine. Bedside echo revealed no pericardial
effusion, possibly depressed EF, no visible aortic aneurysm, and
a dilated IVC. He was taken urgently to CT scan to r/o PE and
dissection.

In the CT scanner, he vomited. no aspiration observed and CXR no
infiltrate. No blood in vomit. He then became tachycardic to the
130s (narrow complex) which appeared to be SVT per ED resident
no ECG confirmation in CT. Dopamine stopped with normalization
of HR. He then again became tachycardic in the 130s, and this
time broke with carotid massage back down to 70. Still
hypotensive in 70s and so started on neo. CT showed no PE or
dissection.

When he returned, intubated for airway protection given vomiting
and hemodynamic instability. Never hypoxic or with resp
distress.  Good mentation per family. vanc/levoflox/flagyl and
decadron. Lactate was 1.6 and he had 1600 cc UOP. His SBP came
back up to the 160s and the neo was weaned off. Multiple
attempts at right subclavian caused 2 arterial sticks. CXR
showed no pneumo/hemothorax.

Subsequently became hypotensive again, and placed back on neo
and dopa.  Right IJ placed.  Sent to CCU. Given total of 3
liters NS.

Recently had epidural steroid inject ion [**2-23**]. No worsening of
back pain since that time.

Imaging:
[**2-25**] CXR:
Clear lungs.
[**2-25**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
2. Focal mesenteric region of increased attenuation which most
likely represents inflammation secondary to mesenteric
panniculitis, or less likely trauma, edema, or tumor (lymphoma).
There is no evidence of mesenteric vasculature or bowel
compromise. A biopsy or CT scan in the future may provide
further diagnostic information.
3. Fluid within the esophagus which increases this patient's
risk of aspiration.
4. Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver which
most likely represent simple liver cysts; however, an ultrasound
examination could be performed for confirmation when the patient
is clinically stabilized.
[**2-27**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 M with fever and hypotension intubated electively for airway
protection.
.
# Hypotension:
He was hypotensive in the emergency department which was of
unclear etiology.  This was thought most likely to be due to
hypovolemia due to dehydration as his blood pressure normalized
with IV fluids.  By the end of his hospitalization he had
actually started to become hypertensive and was started on
lisinopril 10 mg daily.  His HCTZ was not restarted as it was
thought this may have been contributing to his hyponatremia.
.
Fever:
This was of unclear etiology and was attributed to a likely
viral syndrome.  He had no localizing signs or symptoms of
infection.  A test for influenza was negative as was a urine
culture.  Blood cultures were pending at discharge.  He was
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole.  Once his culture
data was negative he was switched to po levofloxacin and he was
discharged to complete a seven day course.
.
# Resp Failure:
He was intubated in the ED for airway protection but he was
successfully extubated shortly after arriving to the MICU and
maintained a normal O2 saturation throughout the rest of his
hospital course.
.
# Hyponatremia:
On admission he was initially hyponatremic with a sodium of 129.
 This was thought to be due to a combination of hypovolemia from
dehydration as well as HCTX effect.  With hydration and stopping
his HCTZ his sodium normalized and at discharge it was 134.
.
# Cervical radiculopathy:
He has a history of this and was last seen in neurology clinic
in [**2169**].  He intermittently complained of neck pain during his
admission and was set up with a follow-up appointment in
neurology with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**4-8**] at 3:00.
.
# Lower back pain:
He has a history of chronic lower back pain and spinal stenosis
and has been followed in the pain management center.  He was
kept on his gabapentin and has a follow-up appointment with the
pain clinic.
.
# Urinary hesitancy:
This is also a chronic issue for him and he was started on
tamsulosin during his hospitalization with some effect.  He has
a follow-up appointment in the urology clinic.
.
# Focal mesenteric thickening on CT scan:
His abdominal exam was benign and he did not complain of
abdominal pain.  The general surgery service was consulted and
did not recommend any intervention.
.
# Dispo:
He was discharged to home with plans for home physical therapy
as he had previously had.  He was also set up for appointments
with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain clinic, urology, and neurology.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old gentleman,
who sustained a 30-foot fall, hitting a porch prior to
landing on the ground.  There was no loss of consciousness,
and the patient arrived in the Trauma Bay complaining of a
chest pain on arrival.  He was noted to have a massive
bleeding from his oropharynx and became hypotensive to the
60s.  He was emergently intubated, and a right femoral cordis
was placed.  His blood pressure improved with a fluid
resuscitation, and his chest x-ray was clear.  He had good
saturations after intubation.  A DPL was performed given his
hypotension as an unknown source that was positive after
instillation of 1 L of saline.  He was also noted to have a
left upper extremity open fracture.  He was taken emergently
to the operating room for exploration.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical exam:  Heart rate was
88, blood pressure 82/palpations, and 02 saturation 90
percent.  The patient had an unstable face with a lip
laceration and blood in his oropharynx.  GCS of 15.  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive with TMs clear.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Sternum stable with no crepitus.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Rectal was guaiac
negative with a normal prostate and normal tone.  Back showed
no step-offs or lacerations.  Pelvis was stable.  Left
forearm with an open fracture unstable with a 2 plus radial
pulse.  Right arm question dislocation, and left and right
lower extremities are without deformities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit
38.9, and platelets 244,000.  Chemistry-7:  Sodium 143,
potassium 4, chloride 104, and bicarbonate 29.  PT was 12.2,
PTT 19.4, INR 1.0, fibrinogen 199, and lactate was 3.5.  ABG:
pH was 7.38, pCO2 43, pO2 232, bicarbonate 26, and base
deficit minus 2.  UA was moderate blood and urine tox
negative.  Initial films:  Chest x-ray negative and pelvis
negative.  Left forearm showed an ulnar fracture with radial
head displacement.  Left shoulder was negative.  Left wrist
was negative.  Right shoulder, a nondisplaced fracture of the
greater tuberosity.  A right humeral neck fracture that was
nondisplaced and impacted.  CT of the head:  Frontal
contusion, small temporal bleed, frontal sinus fracture of
the anterior and posterior table, and Le [**Location 56204**] fracture.
CT of the C-spine was negative.  CT of the chest showed
bilateral pneumothoraces, right greater than left, with a
right upper lobe collapse and a sternal fracture.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As per HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] was taken
emergently to the operating room for exploration.  On
entering the abdomen, they found a laceration of the
transverse mesocolon, splenic decapsulation, liver
laceration, and multiple colonic deserosalizations.  The
splenic decapsulation was repaired, as were the serosal
injuries to the colon.  The transverse mesocolon was
repaired, as was the liver laceration.  The Orthopedic
Surgery team then came into the operating room for washout
and closed reduction of his left Monteggia fracture of the
radial head without long-arm splinting.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure without
hypothermia.  Of note, prior to this, because of the known
intracranial hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability,
Neurosurgery was called for bolt placement.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] ICP
monitor was placed with pressures in the 10 to 13 range.  He
was also placed on IV Ancef perioperatively.  He was then
taken to the Trauma ICU where several consults were obtained,
including an Ophthalmology consult regarding his orbital wall
fractures.  They did not identify any entrapment on CT and
recommended outpatient followup.  He had subsequent bilateral
chest tubes placed and a subclavian line placed on return to
the ICU.  He was seen by Oromaxillofacial Surgery regarding
his facial fractures and was taken to the operating room on
[**2156-4-12**] for open reduction and internal fixation of his mid
face fractures.  Of note, he had a large laceration of his
eyebrow/nasal region that had been closed on the day of
admission.  Of note, because of his multiple facial injuries
and his deteriorating respiratory status over the course of
his ICU stay, he ended up developing Pseudomonas in his
urine.  A tracheostomy was performed on [**2156-4-7**].  He also
had an IVC filter placed on [**2156-4-12**] after bilateral lower
extremity ultrasound revealed a right common femoral vein
nonocclusive thrombus.  A CTA of the chest to evaluate for
pulmonary embolus was negative, but was a poor quality study.
He was subsequently additionally started on a heparin drip.
However, there was difficulty in making him therapeutic, and
a Hematology consult was obtained.  However, he was deemed to
have no identifiable hematologic problem and was eventually
maintained on goal PTT.  Coumadin was subsequently started.
He was maintained on antibiotics for the Pseudomonas in his
sputum.  He did continue to spike temperatures during his ICU
stay and required frequent suctioning and aggressive
pulmonary toilet to manage his copious secretions.  After
recovering from his last operation, which was the ORIF of his
facial fractures, he was finally transferred to the floor on
[**2156-4-20**].  Due to the fact that he was now a candidate for
anticoagulation, Vascular Surgery was re-consulted and his
IVC filter was removed.  He was then placed on Lovenox for
anticoagulation purposes.  He was able then to ambulate with
physical therapy.  However, he continued to have a very poor
p.o. intake.  We strongly encouraged p.o., and he stabilized
his intake and was cleared by Speech and Swallow and was
deemed stable for discharge to home from that standpoint.  He
was also placed on a Passy-Muir valve, which he tolerated
well.  He defervesced, and his antibiotics were stopped, and
he remained without any further infectious issues.  His
mental status improved, and he was able to follow commands,
and he was oriented x 3.  Once his mental status had
improved, his C-spine was clinically cleared and his C-collar
was removed.  He was followed up by Orthopedic Surgery, who
revised his cast after doing repeat films of his left upper
extremity.  He continued to progress well, and he was deemed
stable for discharge to home on postoperative day numbers 29
and 17, which was also hospital day number 30.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post fall with multiple
injuries, including:

Mesocolic laceration.

Splenic laceration.

Liver laceration.

Colonic deserosalization x 3.

Le [**Location 56204**] fracture with fractures of the anterior and

grafting times two and aortic valve replacement.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported intubated to
the PACU in stable condition on a Levophed drip, Milrinone
drip, and a Propofol drip.  The patient had atrial wires and
a chest tube.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was continued on his
Levophed drip and Milrinone drip over night.  The patient was
extubated over night and was on a nasal cannula of 4 Lungs:,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  The patient's vital signs
were otherwise stable.

The patient had a postoperative hematocrit of 26.8; otherwise
laboratory values were all within normal limits.  The patient
was encouraged to be out of bed.  Drips were weaned.  The
patient was started on his Plavix.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40-year-old
female with complaints of headache and dizziness.  In [**2137-1-30**], the patient had headache with neck stiffness and was
unable to walk for 45 minutes.  The patient also had a
similar episode a year and a half ago where she had inability
to walk without pain.  She had a headache at that time which
was relieved with Tylenol.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Bactrim which causes a rash.

pressure was 104/73, pulse 79.  In general, she was a woman
in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Nonicteric.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are
full.  Pharynx is benign.  Tongue midline.  Neck is supple.
Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac:  S1, S2, regular,
rate, and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
negative bruits.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Palpable pulses.  Gait was steady.

The patient is being admitted status post cerebral aneurysm
with clipping.  The patient underwent right MCA and a right
A-comm aneurysm clipping via a right pterional craniotomy
without intraoperative complication.  Postoperative vital
signs are stable.  Patient was afebrile.  She was awake,
alert.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  EOMs
are full.  No facial droop, no drift.  Strength down the legs
was [**6-3**].

On postoperative day #1, the patient was taken to
arteriogram, where she underwent a cerebral angiogram to
evaluate clipping of the aneurysm.  It was found at that time
that the patient had a third aneurysm and that the MCA
aneurysm which was clipped was at the origin of the anterior
temporal artery and not the one at the MCA bifurcation.  The
patient was therefore taken back to the operating room for a
clipping of the second MCA aneurysm without intraoperative
complication.

The patient was monitored in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  She was alert, awake, oriented, complaining of severe
headache, moving all extremities.  EOMs full, negative drift,
a smile was symmetric, IP is [**6-3**].  The patient was then
discharged to the floor on [**2137-4-5**].  She has been out of
bed and ambulating with Physical Therapy, tolerating a
regular diet, and voiding spontaneously.

She has been seen by Physical Therapy, and was found to be
safe to discharge to home with home physical therapy on

Therapy.  He complained about pain and weakness in his left
arm.  The patient reported it was worse immediately
postoperatively and slowly improved with time.  On serial
examinations which were performed, the patient's strength had
improved over the preceding two days.

On postoperative day four, an Occupational Therapy
consultation was obtained who found that the patient did not
need immediate Occupational Therapy treatment at this time.
Their recommendation was to follow up on an outpatient basis
in two to three weeks if he did not recover significantly at
this time.  The patient remained afebrile.  Vital signs were
stable.  He was exercising with Physical Therapy.  No
concerns.  No active issues.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post AVR.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
female who is status post AVR in [**2139**] for aortic stenosis
with prosthetic valve, symptomatic, during routine echo which
showed severe aortic insufficiency and poorly functioning
valve, although patient remained asymptomatic.  The patient
also underwent cardiac catheterization which showed again
significant valvular dysfunction with insignificant coronary
artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 77 and regular, blood pressure
154/66.  HEENT:  No lymphadenopathy.  Neck, no JVD, bruits.
Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart, regular
rate and rhythm, 4/6 systolic ejection murmur at second
intercostal space, radiating up to the neck.  Extremities,
warm, well perfused, no edema.  Pulses strong and equal
bilaterally.  EKG, PVCs, no ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2157-8-10**].  During placement of monitoring lines by
anesthesia team, the patient became asystolic for a brief
period of time and came back after chest compressions,
Atropine and Epinephrine.  Intraoperatively the patient had
supracoronary aortic rupture which required large graft
placement.  She also had aortic valve successfully replaced
with 21 mm pericardial valve.  Pacing wires as well as
mediastinal and pleural tubes were placed intraoperatively.
The patient was transferred to ICU in stable condition.  On
postoperative day #1 the patient had a few episodes of
asystolic which resolved spontaneously and did not require
any treatment.  Patient was afebrile, vital signs were
stable.  Postoperative day #2 the patient was extubated
without complications and episodes of atrial fibrillation
responded to two Amiodarone boluses.  She was also started on
Lasix.  She was transferred to the regular floor in stable
condition.  On postoperative day #3, overnight, patient had
an episode of atrial fibrillation.  She again responded
really well to Amiodarone boluses, was started on oral
Amiodarone.  Her chest tube was discontinued without
complications.  Foley was discontinued.  Postoperative day #5
wires were taken out without complication, patient again had
an episode of atrial fibrillation responding really well to
Amiodarone and remained afebrile, vital signs stable,
ambulating well with PT.  No concerns, no active issues.

This is an addendum to a discharge summary.

On the night of [**8-15**], the patient had a 10 second
complete heart block.  While she was walking with the family,
the patient collapsed, felt nauseated.  Afterwards, the
patient's amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient was moved
to bed rest, had a electrodes placed in her chest rest of the
night and the next day were unremarkable.  EP was consulted
who recommended discontinuing amiodarone which was done, as
well as pacemaker placement.  That night, the patient had
another episode of complete heart block which lasted
approximately six seconds.  The patient was in bed, did not
have nausea or any other symptoms after that or prior to that
episode.  The patient remained afebrile.  Rest of vital signs
stable.  The patient was in normal sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day #6, the patient had a dual chamber
pacemaker placed by EPS service.  Operation went without
complications.  It was reported that the patient is now
ventricularly paced, but has atrial fibrillation as an
underlying ............., so the patient was started on
Warfarin when she came back to the floor as well as restarted
on amiodarone in an attempt to convert the patient.

Po[**Last Name (STitle) **]ative day #7, the patient is afebrile.  Vital signs
are stable.  The patient will be discharged home with follow
up by pacemaker clinic, EPS service and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old,
right handed female who started experiencing nausea and
vomiting one week ago.  She felt dizzy and had diplopia.  She
fell the day prior to admission and was brought back to bed
and could not get out of bed until the day of admission when
EMS was called.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital
where a CT of her head showed left frontal hemorrhage and
right occipital hemorrhage.  Also a mass was detected on her
chest x-ray and confirmed by chest CT.  Patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lumbar diskectomy.  Hypertension.
Depression.

ALLERGIES:  None known.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day, Univasc
30 mg q.day, thiamine 100 mg IM, MVI one p.o. q.day, Levaquin
500 mg IV q.24 hours, atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.a.m., Norvasc 10
mg p.o. q.day, folate 1 mg p.o. q.day, Tylenol and magnesium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's heart rate was 46, blood
pressure 158/51, SAO2 96 percent, respiratory rate 19.
Patient was awake, alert, slightly lethargic, oriented times
two.  Lungs were clear, left lung slightly coarse breath
sounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender.  Cardiac regular rate and
rhythm.  Extremities had no edema.  Neurologic exam showed an
awake, slightly lethargic, oriented times two, not to time,
slightly reversed when following commands.  Right eye had
slightly decreased adduction, slight decreased elevation of
the right eye.  Also left lateral gaze nystagmus.  Face was
symmetric.  Frontalis was intact.  Moderate dysarthria.  No
obvious drift.  Upper and lower extremities were full [**5-18**] for
muscle.  Reflexes were 1+ in the upper extremities and 1 in
the lower extremities.  No Hoffmann, no clonus.  Sensation
was intact to lower extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit 27.4,
platelets 309.  INR 1.3, PTT 33.2.  Sodium 139, potassium
3.4, chloride 106, CO2 22.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan for this patient was admission to
the ICU, obtain an MRI with gadolinium.  She was made NPO, IV
fluids at 80 an hour.  Neuro checks were q.one hour.  She was
given mannitol 25 q.four hours and Decadron 8 mg q.four
hours.  On [**8-13**] the patient was noted to be arousable,
oriented to person only, very dysarthric, more lethargic than
the previous day.  She had received Ativan at the time of
examination.  She did have a slight right drift.  She had an
MRI which showed a large right cerebellar T2 hypointense and
T1 hyperintense mass which measured about 5 cm in maximal
dimension.  A DWI scan [**Month (only) 3780**] loss of signal in the
right cerebellum and left frontal lobe.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and
in the anterior middle cerebral artery.  There was flow in
the vertebral arteries.  The impression was cerebellar and
cerebral hemorrhagic masses consistent with metastasis.  The
cerebellar mass is large and there is superior herniation
into the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.

Given the patient's exam and MRI findings, it was felt that
the patient should have an emergent craniotomy for removal of
this tumor and the hemorrhagic lesion.  Prior to surgery
patient did have an interventional pulmonology consult.  They
saw her and felt she had a left upper lobe mass infiltrate
with the diagnosis that included possible pneumonia versus
lung mass versus combination.  They did follow her throughout
her stay here and did not recommend that she needed
bronchoscopy at this time.  They referred her to oncology.

The patient was brought to the O.R. on [**2144-8-13**] where she
underwent craniotomy and removal of the right cerebellar
hemorrhagic lesion.  Patient did well intraoperatively and
had no complications.  On post-op day one patient was awake,
oriented times name only, inattentive, unable to follow
midline commands.  She had abduction depression of the right
eye.  Pupils were 5 to 3.5 in the right eye and left eye 4.5
to 2.5.  She had a question of bilateral slight pronator
drift, greater on the right than the left.  Recommendations
were to keep her blood pressure less than 150, use minimal
Ativan only and to slowly advance her diet.  Her post-op
hematocrit was 25.9.  Also on the 1st she had repeat MRI
which showed status post resection of right cerebellar
hemorrhagic lesion without residual enhancement.  Left
frontal hemorrhagic lesion with enhancement was suggestive of
metastatic disease.

The patient did require the use of Nipride to keep her
systolic blood pressure less than 140.  She did have periods
of agitation at times.  On [**8-15**] patient was awake,
continued in the ICU.  Her face was symmetric.  No rebound,
no drift.  Finger to nose showed slight right dysmetria.
Patient was advanced out of bed to a chair.  Her activity was
also increased.  Patient was continued on IV Decadron 4 mg
q.six hours.  In the late afternoon of the 2nd, patient was
transferred out of the unit awake, alert and oriented times
three, moving all extremities.  Vital signs were stable.  She
did see physical therapy when moved to the floor who
recommended that she receive visitations every day by them to
assist with her impaired mobility and help with her impaired
mental status.

On [**8-16**] the patient was awake, alert, oriented,
tolerating a diet, ambulating with help.  Her dysarthria was
noted to be improved.  She had a slight right drift noted.
Her dysmetria was also improved.  Her Foley was removed.
Decadron was continued to be weaned.  Occupational therapy
also saw her and assisted her with safety awareness and
helped her with her upper extremities.  On the 5th oncology
saw patient who felt that she most likely will receive
palliative chemotherapy with radiation rather than systemic
chemo.  Patient's special stains for melanoma were found to
be negative on [**8-19**].  Patient will need to go to a rehab
facility for further assistance with her gait and
rehabilitation needs.  She is to follow up in the brain tumor
clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  She also needs to follow up with
hematology/oncology here at [**Hospital1 188**].

The patient was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia that was
diagnosed prior to admission.  She received 10 days of
Levaquin therapy.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To keep the staples clean and dry,
do not get them wet.  She should have them removed on
[**2144-8-26**].  She can come back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 to have those removed
or she can have them removed at her rehab facility.  Right
now her appointment for the brain tumor clinic is pending.
Also her appointment with oncology is pending at this time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcu.
2.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
3.  Nicotine patch 20 mg per 24 hours.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg [**1-16**] tablet b.i.d.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 35F w/HD who presents with lethary course complicated by
tachycardia and possible sepsis.
.
1. Hypotension- probably [**1-30**] AVNRT vs. ventricular tachycardia
in a pt w/baseline EF 10%- cardiology was consulted in the ED
where it was thought that pt should be managed medically.  She
received Adenosine x 2 w/o effect and then was cardioverted.
This was in the setting of infection and deyhdration. Since
arrival she is +9L. CT-A was negative for a PE; random cortisol
33.
- trending cardiac enzymes: 0.39, most likely elevated [**1-30**]
cardioversion
- EP following, plan for medical management of tachycardia
w/Amiodarone: on drip yesterday for 24 hours, started po 200 q
daily [**2189-1-31**].
- cardiology and EP satisfied with patients stability, may
recommend lisinopril low dose as an outpatient, follow up in 1
month with cardiology
.
2. PNA- Patient received levaquin, vanc, flagyl and ceftriaxone
in the ED. Imaging concerning for pneumonia.
- trend leukocytosis and fever curve
- change Unasyn for coverage of aspiration PNA to Augmentin
500mg PO TID today([**3-7**])
- blood cultures: pending
- urine cultures: NGTD final
.
3. Delta MS: Per patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and pt's sister-
patient is at baseline.  Lethargy may have been [**1-30**] infection.
Will continue infectious w/u and treatment. tox screen negative
except for benzos.
.
4. Elevated liver enzymes: most likely [**1-30**] shock liver,
hypotension during v-tach and cardioversion; KUB was normal
[**2189-1-31**].
- trend LFT's: improving over time
- RUQ ultrasound: liver and gallbladder normal with right
pleural effusion and ascites;
.
5. Anemia: stable over hospital course
- Will monitor daily

Echocardiography [**12-1**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-1-25**],
LV systolic function is now more vigorous.

Chest x-ray [**11-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved
from the
prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress: Pt reported to the ED with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath. In the ED, he was initially
desatting to the 80s on a NRB, was put on Bipap, improved quite
rapidly and was eventually able to be weaned down to a NC and
was stable on 2L upon arrival in the MICU. His 02 sat was
continuously monitored. An echocardiography was done (EF>55%),
the results of which are above.
.
#Chest pain: Pt developed left sided chest pain, accompanied by
diaphoresis and mild dyspnea while moving around on [**2121-12-3**].
Pain resolved after about half an hour with sublingual
nitroglycerin and maalox and simethicone.  EKG at the time
showed new ST depressions and T wave inversion in I, aVL.
Troponins were cycled and were 0.16, 0.16, 0.15.  In the
morning, repeat EKG showed persistent T wave inversions, but
resolution of ST depression.  The overall picture was consistent
with an NSTEMI.  The patient underwent a nuclear stress test
which showed normal myocardial uptake and preserved EF of 59%.
He did not undergo catheterization as his stress test was
normal.
.
# Hyperkalemia - emergent hemodialysis at the bedside was
performed and the repeat K+ after dialysis was 3.3.
.
# ESRD - received emergent hemodialysis at the bedside and
resumed on his regular schedule.
.
# CAD - he was continued on his ASA, beta blocker, statin, and
plavix. He had a repeat echo, the results of which are above.
His cardiac enzymes were trended.
.
# Gout - continued allopurinol
.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued statin
.
# Hypertension - continue beta blocker
.
.

Service:  CT SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of an inferior wall myocardial infarction
approximately six years ago.  An echocardiogram in [**2107**]
showed an ejection fraction of 30%.  Chest pain with rest and
on exertion was the chief complaint and the patient was
admitted on [**2109-10-21**] to the emergency room for rule out
myocardial infarction.  An exercise tolerance test at that
time showed an inferior wall defect and now anterior wall
ischemia.  A cardiac catheterization showed the left main
coronary artery to be 30% occluded proximally and 60%
occluded distally, the left anterior descending artery to
have 70% mid-occlusion and 80% ostial occlusion, the right
coronary artery to have 100% ostial occlusion and the left
circumflex coronary artery to be occluded.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history included
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, inferior wall myocardial infarction and bradycardia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Monopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Nitroglycerin patch.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] to
the operating room for coronary artery bypass graft times
four on [**2109-10-28**] with a left internal mammary artery graft
to the left anterior descending artery, a reversed saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery and a right coronary
artery grafts to the second obtuse marginal artery and the
posterior descending artery.

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  In the intensive care
unit, the patient was extubated and weaned off all drips.
The chest tube was discontinued without incident.  The
patient was ambulating at level 5 before discharge.  Upon
discharge, the chest was clear to auscultation.  The heart
rate was regular and normal sinus rhythm.  The incision was
clean with no drainage and no pus.  The sternum was stable.

Postoperatively, the patient's hematocrit was low and
required several units of blood transfusion.  Upon discharge,
however, the hematocrit was 25 and the patient was
asymptomatic with no dizziness, no shortness of breath and no
orthostatic hypotension.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged home with
[**Hospital6 407**] care.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o. every four to six hours
p.r.n. for pain.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was told to follow up with Dr.

Chief Complaint:
blurry vision

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 20 year old female with a past medical history
significant for systemic lupus erythematosis who woke on day of
admission with blurry vision. The patient was initially
diagnosed at age 16 when her fingers swelled up and 6 months
later a kidney biopsy confirmed the lupus nephritis. She's been
medically managed on prednisone and had a trial of cytoxan which
she did not tolerate due to nausea and vomitting. Her
hypertension has been controlled with enalopril, atenolol, and
nifedipine until about 7 days prior to admission when she ran
out of medication and for that reason has been non-adherent.

On the day of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] called 911 and en route to
this facility developed an intense headache, localizing to the
right temporal region. In the ambulance she was discovered to
have a systolic blood pressure of about 300. Upon arrival at the
ED, she developed chest pain and shortness of breath. Morphine,
labetelol 20 IV, atenolol 50 PO, and enalapril 20 PO were
administered. She was then started on a nifedipine drip. Later,
the nifedipine was weaned for a concern of renal insufficiency
and a NTG drip was started at which point her systolic blood
pressure decreased to 180. A head CT was obtained which was
negative but she did have papilledema per the ED notes. An EKG
showed strain. The patient was admitted to the MICU overnight.
Of note, it was discovered that her creatnine was up to 5 from a
baseline of 1.5.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 20 year old woman with hypertensive emergency,
lupus nephritis, and TTP vs. malignant hypertension inducing
thrombocytopenia.

HTN: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a hypertensive emergency, as evidenced by EKG
changes, papilledema, and head CT changes. This was thought
likely secondary to a lupus flare, ARF and poor medication
compliance. She was started back on metoprolol and nifedipine,
but her ACE I was held for the renal failure. The metoprolol was
changed to toprol xl and a clonidine patch were added for better
control and a simplified regimen as there was concern for
patient compliance. Titration of these medications on the
medical floor and addition of hydralazine did not result in
adequate BP control as the patient had several systolic blood
pressure readings in the 250s. She was then transferred to the
intensive care unit for uncontrolled BP accompanied by head
ache. Once there, she received IV antihypertensives and HD was
initiated. Several lbs were taken off, facilitating BP control
with oral medications. She was transferred back to the medical
floor and stabilized on a regimen of clonidine patch Qweek, TID
labetolol, and QD lisinopril.

Rheum: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has SLE with discoid rash and ARF. She was
started on a prednisone burst with calcium supplementation. She
was also started on plaquanil for 1-2 months for her discoid
rash. She will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic, who will
arrange for her to see an ophthalmologist. Of note, her
complement levels were low, her DS DNA was positive and her
anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM were within normal limits.

Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with acute on chronic renal
insufficiency. Her rise in creatinine was dramatic, from
baseline of 1.2 in [**Month (only) 958**] to 5.2 at presentation. This was
thought to be multifactorial, from both HTN and an exacerbation
of SLE. Her ACE inhibitor was initially held, and her creatinine
continued to worsen. Of note, her UA remained somewhat bland,
without acanthocytes. Her blood pressure remained difficult to
control, requiring another trip to the MICU for administration
of IV antihypertensives. It was decided that some of this was
attributed to volume overload, so HD was initiated. A tunnel
line was placed and the patient tolerated the procedure and the
HD well. It was thought that the HD would be temporary but that
the patient would eventually progress to ESRD in the near
future. She was also started on mycophenolate mofetil in the
hopes of slowing her progression to ESRD and giving her a few
months before having to start HD as more permanent renal
replacement. She was discharged with instructions to come for HD
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with ARF, thrombocytopenia, anemia,
and leukopenia. Her haptoglobin was low and LDH was high,
concerning for hemolysis. DIC was considered unlikely since her
coagulation studies were within normal limits but [**Doctor First Name **], TTP/HUS
were considered a possibility. A peripheral smear showed
schistocytes, so the Heme service was consulted, however this
presentation could also be secondary to a malignant hypertension
inducing shearing of erythrocytes and platelets. Her ARF could
be attributed to her hypertension as well. Given the concern for
TTP, the heme service initiated plasmapheresis with the
assistance of the blood bank. The patient had 7 plasmapheresis
treatments, one of which was complicated by symptomatic
hypocalcemia evidenced by abdominal pain. She was plasmapheresed
until her platelets reached 150. Of note, her ADAMST 13 studies
were not consistent with TTP, although these studies are still
investigational. She was also started on folate and iron for her
anemia.

GI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had one episode of hematemesis during
plasmapheresis. This was comprised of approximately 5 cc of
clots of blood concurrently with a hematocrit drop. With this
concern for GIB, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back to the MICU
where an EGD showed diffuse linear erythema of the mucosa with
no bleeding in the stomach body. These findings were compatible
with mild gastritis but did not account for the HCT drop. She
was started on a PPI and asked to avoid NSAIDs.

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: 4.0 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 45% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not
available) of [**2137-5-7**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The IVC is normal in diameter
with >50%
decrease collapse during respiration (estimated RAP 5-10 mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve not well seen. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Results were
reviewed with the Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's
care.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**6-21**]
mmHg. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded but there appears to be distal left
ventricullar and
apical akinesis. Overall left ventricular function is mildly
depressed with an
EF of ~45%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
The aortic valve is not well seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve is not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2137-5-7**], the regional left ventricular dysfunction is new.

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)

normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study of [**2142-4-24**], left ventricular
function appears
improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 66 yo f with COPD, h/o recurrent PNA's, HTN, and
hyperlipidemia who presented with respiratory distress. She was
admitted to the MICU and the following issues were addressed
during her hospitalization.
.
#) Resp failure: The patient was admitted to the MICU for
respiratory distress attributed to a COPD exacerbation. Although
her CXR did not show an infiltrate, she was started empirically
on nebulizer treatments and antibiotics. likely secondary to
COPD exacerbation due to infection. She was started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She was also started on
methylprednisilone for her COPD flare. The patient failed
extubation on [**4-26**] and [**4-28**]. Shortly after both extubation
attempts, the patient's SBP climbed to the 200s and the patient
experienced respiratory distress. Therefore, her failure to
extubate was attributed to both her COPD exacerbation and likely
flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension. After her
first extubation failure, her antibiotic coverage was broadened
to Vanc/Zosyn to cover for nosocomial PNA although no infiltrate
was seen on CXR. She was also continued on IV steroids.  She
completed a 5 day course of Azithromycin and a seven day course
of  Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo. Sputum cx from [**4-28**] grew 1+ GPCs,
sputum from [**4-25**] grew Aspergillus, and sputum from [**4-30**] likely
grew mold thought to be a contaminant. There was no other
evidence of fungal infection.  Blood cultures, repiratory viral
antigens, and viral cx were all negative. The patient was
diuresed and her HTN was controlled on a nitro gtt. She was
succesfully extubated.  She continued to have improving
oxygenation, weaning to 2L oxygen and was transferred to the
floor for 12h, after which she was discharged home on home
oxygen
.
# Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient had ST elevations on EKG
and elevated CE with max CK 650 and Trop 0.66. She was placed on
a heparin. She underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed
mild 3 VD and markedly increased CI. ACS was thought to be
unlikely and the heparin gtt was discontinued. ECHO from [**4-30**]
showed LVEF >55% and no wall motion abnormalities. She was
started on ASA and atorvastatin. A BB was not started [**3-16**] her
severe COPD exacerbation.
.
# Arrhythmia: The patient had an episode of fascicular VT with
hypotension on [**4-27**] which lasted 10-15 minutes. It resolved with
metoprolol 12.5 po. Post-EKG showed a  changed axis from prior.
Cards was consulted and recommended starting the patient on
verapamil.
.
#) HTN: The patient had a labile BP throughout her admission.
The patient's BP was controlled via an esmolol gtt initially
which was weaned once she was intubated and sedated. She was
placed on a nitro gtt prior to her successful extubation with
good effect. She was transitioned to lisinopril and verapamil
for BP control.
.
#) h/o recurrent sinusitis: She was continued on fluticasone
nasal spray.
.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man
with a history of peptic ulcer disease, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2179**] as well as
[**2193**], temporal arteritis, who presented with melenas  and
chest pain. The patient reported melanotic stools times 5
since 4 p.m. on the day prior to admission. No hematemesis or
hematochezia. Stools were loose. The patient had a history of
melena in [**2192-5-14**]. The patient also reported being
lightheaded, fatigued with an increase in his ch set
discomfort for which he was taking sublingual nitroglycerin
with relief. On the a.m. of presentation, the symptoms
persisted; the patient contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP who sent him to the
[**Name (NI) **]. In the ED, the p was found to have a hematocrit of 22.9
decreased from a baseline of 32 to 38. He was given IV
Protonix, IV fluids, and transfused the first of 2 units of
packed red blood cells. Gastroenterology was consulted. The
patient initially had an EKG with slight inferior changes
while the patient was pain free. The patient then had an
episode of [**9-23**] substernal chest pain in the ED with 3 to [**Street Address(2) 94587**] changes in V3 to V4.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for upper gastrointestinal
bleed in [**2192-5-14**]. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an
ulcer in the pylorus and chronic gastritis, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2179**] and [**2193**],
benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of temporal arteritis,
pemphigoid, history of anemia, history of small bowel
volvulus, status post appendectomies, status post inguinal
hernia repair x2, history of colonic polyps, and sigmoid
diverticulosis.

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on:

1. Celebrex.
2. Aspirin.
3. Prednisone.
4. Atenolol.
5. Imdur.
6. Nitroglycerin p.r.n.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 2447**].
Remote tobacco history. Social alcohol use, which is
infrequent. Married with 1 son.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION AS FOLLOWS:  VITAL SIGNS:
Vital signs of 98.9 temperature, blood pressure 128/80, pulse
72, respiratory rate of 13, and oxygen 100% on 3 liters.
GENERAL: The patient appeared comfortable.
HEENT: Examination was unremarkable except for pale
conjunctiva, dry mucosa.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for the hematocrit of 23 as
stated above, a potassium of 5.3, a BUN 78. Initial CK was
107 with an MB of 6 and a troponin of 0.02. INR was 1.0.
Urinalysis was unremarkable. As stated above, the patient had
2 EKGs and the second of which showed 2 to [**Street Address(2) 5366**] changes in
V3 to V6. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary
process, so the patient was admitted to the hospital.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AS FOLLOWS:  GI: The
patient was felt to likely have another bleeding ulcer as the
etiology of his melanotic stools and anemia. The patient had
a history of Helicobacter pylori in the past that was
treated. The patient was felt to require EGD to evaluate for
recurrent infection as well as ongoing bleeding. The patient
was initially admitted to the ICU. Gastroenterology was
consulted. The patient was taken for EGD on [**6-13**], which
showed a deep antral ulcer, no acute bleeding. The ulcer was
injected.

The patient was initially continued on IV b.i.d. Protonix.
Hematocrits were followed and the patient was maintained on 2
peripheral IV's at all times, and aspirin was held. The
patient has another episode of melanotic stool. On [**2194-6-14**],
he was taken for another EGD, at that time which showed the
ulcer was not bleeding. As a result, the patient was felt to
be stable for discharge to home from a GI perspective with
continuation of the b.i.d. Protonix. The patient to follow up
for a repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks as an outpatient.

Cardiac: Cardiac enzymes had been significant for elevated
troponin on admission. Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] who did not
recommend cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass
graft. The patient initially received heparin and was
restarted on aspirin, which was approved by GI as long as the
patient had serial hematocrits. The patient was transfused to
keep the hematocrit above 30. He was restarted on atenolol.
The patient was also on Imdur for a longer-acting vasodilator
effect. The patient had a couple of episodes of further chest
pain during the admission but had no further EKG changes.

Pulmonary: The patient had some desaturations to 70's and
80's with ambulation without improvement with oxygen with
ambulation, but at this time the patient was completely
asymptomatic and the patient's oxygen saturation recovered
spontaneously to the high 90's on room air with rest. As a
result, this was felt to possibly be not reflective of the
patient's pulmonary status, but reflective of some peripheral
vascular changes with ambulation. The patient was not felt to
need inpatient workup and will follow up with PCP as an
outpatient.

Hematology: The patient with acute blood loss anemia,
received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells, had
serial hematocrits while on heparin gtt and was transfused to
keep the hematocrit above 30.

Musculoskeletal: The patient was restarted on his prednisone
for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Gastric ulcer.
Gastrointestinal bleed.
Demand ischemia, elevated troponins, and EKG changes in the
setting of acute blood loss anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Nitroglycerin sublingual.
2. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. daily.
3. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. p.m., 50 mg p.o. q. a.m.
4. Protonix 40 p.o. b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 325 mg.
6. Isosorbide mononitrate.

gentleman who woke up with severe headache, woke up with a
[**11-20**] frontal headache that was constant.  Took Advil and
Tylenol without relief.  Headache persisted.  He went to an
outside hospital, where an MRI of the brain showed
hydrocephalus and a cystic mass around the pineal gland.  The
patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] for further management.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Gastric wrap.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No other medical history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 84, blood pressure 133/78,
respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 97 percent in room
air.  The patient is lying in bed with his eyes covered.  He
is alert and oriented times three.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light, extraocular movements full with positive
photophobia and neck stiffness.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No
peripheral edema.  Neurologic examination: Cranial nerves II
through XII intact; strength 5/5 in all muscle groups.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for close neurologic observation.  He had a vent
drain placed on [**2140-12-13**] due to hydrocephalus.  On
[**2140-12-14**], the patient was taken to the operating room
and had transcallosal resection of a third ventricle tumor
and continued with his vent drain in placed.  The patient was
monitored in the PACU overnight, where he remained
neurologically stable.

On [**2140-12-16**], the patient was monitored on the Step-
Down Unit.  He was awake, alert and oriented.  Speech was
fluent.  The patient complained of double vision on lateral
gaze.  His strength was [**6-15**] in all muscle groups.  His
dressing was clean, dry and intact.  The patient had an MRI
of his entire spine that showed no evidence of metastatic
disease.  The patient continued to have his vent drain in
place.  Postoperatively, neurologically, the patient was
awake, alert and oriented times two, having difficulty with
short term memory postoperatively.

On [**2140-12-19**], the drain was raised to 15 cm above the
tragus.  The patient continued to have difficulty with short
term memory but was otherwise intact neurologically.  On
[**2140-12-20**], the patient's drain was raised to 20 cm
above the tragus.  The patient continued to remain
neurologically stable.  His Decadron was weaned down to 3 mg
twice a day.

On [**2140-12-24**], pathology of the mass that was removed
was consistent with ependymoma.  The patient's drain was
raised to 25 cm above the tragus.  The patient remained
neurologically stable and was out of bed to chair.  On
[**2140-12-25**], the drain was clamped.  The patient
remained neurologically stable.  On [**2140-12-26**], the
patient had a head CT scan done, which showed no change in
the size of his ventricles.  The drain was removed on
[**2140-12-26**] and the patient remained neurologically
stable.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home [**2140-12-27**].  Follow-up in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic in one week for
staple removal.  The patient's condition was stable at the
time of discharge.  Discharge medications included Percocet
one to two tablets po every four hours as needed, Decadron 2
mg po every 12 hours, pantoprazole 40 mg po once daily.  His
condition was stable at the time of discharge.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease requiring
revascularization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old man in
generally good health with a new onset of dyspnea on exertion
and angina who underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**8-29**]
which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with an
ejection fraction of 40%.  There was disease in the proximal
LAD with a stenosis at D1 of 70% and 95% osteal D1 lesion,
95% distal RCA lesion with occluded PDA, mild PVB disease and
collaterals left to right.  Given these findings, he was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Included Gemfibrozil, Atenolol, Aspirin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2146-8-29**] where he underwent a CABG
times three as follows: LIMA to LAD, left radial to D1
saphenous vein graft to PDA performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], assisted
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11743**].  Postoperative ejection fraction was 50-55%.
The patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery
recovery unit on Nitroglycerin and Neo-Synephrine.  The
patient had a temperature immediately postoperatively and
sputum cultures were sent that grew out gram negative rods
for which she was subsequently treated with Levofloxacin.
The patient otherwise did well and was transferred to the
floor by postoperative day #3.  He did have another fever
spike on postoperative day #3 at which point the Levofloxacin
was begun for the gram negative rods in the sputum.  He also
had one episode where he complained of epigastric pain and
EKG was obtained which demonstrated a right bundle branch
block.  Enzymes were recycled and were downward trending.  He
did undergo a blood transfusion on postoperative day #4 for a
hematocrit of 20 and tachycardia with mild hypotension.  The
patient otherwise did very well.  By postoperative day #5 was
without complaints.  On physical exam, heart rate was 85,
blood pressure 116/70, clear to auscultation on the right
with bronchial breath sounds at the left base and egophony.
His sternum was stable with a regular rate and rhythm.  His
abdomen was soft.  His extremities were with minimal edema.
Given these findings and the fact that he was ambulating
extremely well, it was felt that he was stable for discharge.
He was discharged on Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, potassium
chloride 20 mEq po q d for 7 days, Lasix 20 mg po bid for 7
days, Colace 100 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 81
mg po q d, Motrin prn, Imdur 30 mg po q d, Niferex 150 mg po
q d and Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d for 7 days for treatment
of a potential hospital acquired pneumonia as well as
Percocet.  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in [**1-9**] weeks as well as his primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-9**]
weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times three
performed on [**2146-8-29**].

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory
laparotomy, right
adrenalectomy and right hepatic segment 6 resection. Please see
operative report for details. EBL was 3 liters. An introp U/S
revealed- liver echogenicity appeared unremarkable. Within the
posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, there was s a
5.5 x 3.3 cm well- circumscribed, slightly hypoechoic lesion
that contained a degree of increased through transmission
suggesting at least some cystic components. The relationship of
this to the surrounding vasculature, particularly the posterior
branch of the right portal vein was demonstrated. No other
additional lesions were found.Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were removed by
postop day 5. Pathology returned positive for 1. Right adrenal
mass, excision (A-F):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note.
2. Liver segment six, resection (G-O):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note. Endocrinology was to follow and the plan
was to use ________ as an outpatient.

Postop she was in the SICU for fluid management and ATN.
Baseline creatinine was 0.6. Nephrology was consulted.
Creatinine trended down to 1.1 by POD 8. Renal u/s was normal.
Stress dose steroids were given preop and postop per
Endocrinology. Endocrinology preferred a slow 6 month steroid
taper. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tapered prednisone after one week as she
developed an incision infection necessitating opening the
incision and using a wound vac.  A CT of the abd was done on
which demonstrated Two ill-defined fluid collections
post-surgical site that were extrahepatic and could represent
postoperative seromas, bilomas, or less likely abscesses.
Multiple scattered foci of air, likely postoperative. 2.
Increased stranding about the head of the pancreas, possibly
pancreatitis. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural
effusion. Amylase and lipase were normal. LFTs preop were ast
1298, alt 1308, alk phos 64 and tbili 0.7. These trended down
postop with the exception of the alk phos which increased to as
high as 806 on HD 20. Subsequently, this has decreased some to
504 as of [**11-13**].

She required PICC line placement for IV antibiotics and TPN as
her kcals were insufficient. Her appetite was diminished. She
appeared apathetic on many days and expressed feelings of
sadness. Psychiatry saw her and agreed with the team that she
was experiencing intermittent delerium. There was concern that
she was experiencing the effects of less cortisol. Neurology
recommended a CT and EEG.  A head CT was done for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status. This was negative for bleed/mass on [**10-29**]. An EEG
was performed which demonstrated mild encephalopathy. TSH was
3.4.  Psychiatry did not recommend antidepressents or stimulants
at the time.

On CT a right pleural effusion was noted. She experienced desats
and sob. Pleuracentesis was performed on [**11-6**] (HD 20)with a
negative culture. A f/u cxr was improved and without
pneumothorax.

She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and
Flagyl for the wound x 4 days. These antibiotics were switched
to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep
veridans, sparse yeast, Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and
staph coag positive resistent to levo/oxicillin/penicillin and
sensitive to vanco. Vanco levels were monitored. Creatinine
remained stable. She developed a 2nd UTI,yeast which was treated
with a GU Ampho bladder irrigant x3 days. This was due to finish
on [**11-13**] pm. Repeat u/a and cx were sent on [**11-13**].

A repeat abd CT revealed stable appearance of hepatic fluid
collections with some debris and air in the surgical bed.
Bibasilar atelectasis with stable right pleural effusion.
Stable appearance of right abdominal wall defect overlying
surgical site. Interval development of nonocclusive thrombus
within the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. She was started on
coumadin and IV heparin until she was therapeutic. INR Goal was
[**1-31**]. INR on [**11-13**] was 2.6

On [**11-12**] after taking off the vac and reviewing the CT, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was inserted thru the wound into a peri-hepatic collection
and placed to bulb suction.  Water soluble contrast was
administered at the bedside through this catheter. Contrast was
administered. Contrast was seen surrounding this wound and
draining along the right lateral aspect of the wound into
dressing, however, no definite communication into the abdominal
cavity noted. Midline chevron scar and multiple clips scattered
across the abdomen were seen. Remainder of abdomen was gasless.
Small amount of oral contrast seen in the rectum.  She then
underwent successful drainage catheter placement in collection
in the subhepatic and hepatic areas on [**2194-11-12**].

The plan is for her to go to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on TPN via a R picc
with a RUQ incision wound vac. She has 2 hepatic drains to
gravity drainage and meropenum/vanco will continue until next
week. She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**11-17**] and
with endocrinology as an outpatient.

Please schedule GYN follow up of postmenopausal bleeding noted
on POD #5.Pelvic U/S (prelim report) - Study v. limited as
patient was not able to achieve proper positioning; uterus 8.0 x
4.4 x 4.5 cm; endometrium is not well visualized; ovaries not
visualized. She experienced minimal spotting while hospitalized.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old
woman with a history of end stage liver disease secondary to
hepatitis C complicated by esophageal varices as well as a
history of encephalopathy and prior spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for
management of her ascites.  On that hospitalization multiple
attempts were made to manage her fluid overload with
diuretics, but she was ultimately refractory to them.  She
was referred for TIPS procedure for improved fluid
management.  The patient was readmitted on the day of
admission on [**4-7**] for TIPS.  The procedure was notable for
having somewhat difficult access, but no complications with
an estimated blood loss of 100 cc.  At the procedure she
received 4 mg of Versed, 600 of propofol, 150 of fentanyl.
She had been hemodynamically stable for several hours post
procedure, but then her blood pressure dropped from 100/40 to
70s to 80s over 30s and her heart rate remained sinus tach.
At the time, although her urine output remained strong, she
was transferred to the medical ICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C genotype 1A complicated by
cirrhosis, esophageal varices, encephalopathy and presumptive
SBP.  Type 2 diabetes.  Obesity.  Hypertension.  Asthma.
Esophageal candidiasis.  Gastroparesis.  Depression.  Status
post cholecystectomy.  Status post seven spur surgeries.
Hypothyroidism.  Amenorrhea.  Migraines.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a prior machine operator on
disability.  She is not married.  She lives with her son.
She has a 15 pack year tobacco history, she quit in [**Month (only) 359**].
She has a history of alcohol use, particularly heavy in the
mid-[**2109**].  She has a history of IV drug abuse, none since
the [**2109**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  It does not include liver
disease or bleeding disorder.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.5,
pulse 96, BP 95/48, respiratory rate 16, sating 98 percent on
3 liters.  In general, she was a pleasant, middle aged woman
lying in no acute distress.  Head and neck exams showed
normocephalic, atraumatic head with pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx was slightly dry.  On neck exam she had a
right central venous line with mild ooze.  Heart was
tachycardiac with regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.  Abdomen was
soft, nondistended, nontender with active bowel sounds.  She
had guaiac positive stool.  Extremities had 2+ edema to the
knees.  On neuro exam she was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.  Strength and
sensation were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 26.8, platelets

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypotension.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
hypotension.  The underlying etiology was not initially
clear, although the differential included excess anesthesia
from the procedure, particularly given her liver disease
versus hypovolemia from a hemorrhage, either around the liver
into the abdomen or within the GI tract versus sepsis.  She
was started empirically on antibiotics with levo and Flagyl.
She had an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites for
possible paracentesis.  There was no ascites.  She was
maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis for several days.  She
was transfused one unit of packed cells and given fluids to
improve her blood pressure and it responded appropriately.
She was started on Neo-Synephrine to keep her MAPS greater
than 55.  It took several days, but this was ultimately
weaned.  The entire time she had excellent urine output.  As
cultures continued to be negative and the patient had no
fever or white count, she was not maintained SBP antibiotic
coverage and once she was maintained on pressors, she was
able to be transferred out to the floor.  She had no further
evidence of hypotension while on the medicine floor.

2.  Hypoxia/congestive heart failure.  The patient was given
vigorous IV fluids hydration and blood during her MICU stay.
She subsequently became progressively hypoxic with diffuse
wheezing and a chest film that was consistent with fluid
overload.  She was started with diuresis once she was on the
medicine floor with rapid improvement in her hypoxia and her
lung exam.  Once the pulmonary edema was improved, her
exercise tolerance improved dramatically.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient does have a history of asthma and
she was wheezing significantly when she hit the floor.  She
responded well to IV Lasix and frequent nebulizer treatments.
These will be continued as an outpatient per her
prehospitalization regimen.

4.  Status post TIPS.  The patient did not have any evidence
of encephalopathy and her abdominal distention improved
significantly over the course of her admission.  She was
between 2 and 3 liters negative per day and did not have an
untoward effects with respect to her renal failure.

5.  Renal.  The patient's creatinine slightly increased on
admission to the ICU.  However, over the course of her
admission, her creatinine went down to 1.0 by discharge which
is as good, if not better, than her typical baseline.

6.  Infectious disease.  When the patient was out on the
floor, she did not show any evidence of infection.  She was
continued on SBP prophylaxis regimen of Levaquin q.day.

7.  Endocrine.  The patient was continued on her diabetes
regimen with glargine and a sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
male smoker with diabetes, and hypertension, and hepatitis C,
and status post anterior myocardial infarction who presented
with anterior myocardial infarction.

At midnight on the day prior to admission, the patient
experienced substernal chest pain while sitting at rest in
his bed.  The pain was radiating to his arms.  It was
described as not pleuritic.  It was associated with shortness
of breath.  The patient took sublingual nitroglycerin without
relief.  The pain lasted 10 minutes until Emergency Medical
Service arrived.  He was found to be hypertensive at 210/100.

The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm at 54, normal axis, and normal intervals.  ST
elevations were noted to be 1 mm to 2 mm in leads V2 through
V5 and aVL.  Reciprocal ST depressions of 2 mm were seen in
leads II, III, and aVF.  The patient's electrocardiogram also
showed poor R wave progression.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory.  He
was randomized to cool myocardial infarction protocol.  On
catheterization, the patient was found to have left main
coronary artery without flow-limiting lesions.  A 50% mid
distal lesion was seen in the left anterior descending artery
along with an occluded first diagonal that was stented.  The
left circumflex, right coronary artery, and ramus intermedius
were found to be normal.  Pulmonary artery saturation was
75%.  Pulmonary artery pressure was 27/11.  Per the protocol,
the patient was cooled to 33 degrees for five hours.  He was
started on aspirin, Integrilin, and Plavix and received a
heparin bolus.  He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old man was
transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] on the [**10-24**] to
[**Hospital1 69**].  He has a history of
coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
prostate and lung cancer with severe carotid stenosis and
transient ischemic attacks who is referred now with the
abrupt onset of speech difficulty and right-sided weakness.
The patient had been hospitalized briefly in [**Month (only) 116**] with speech
difficulty and right-sided weakness.  His studies back in [**Month (only) 116**]
showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis and there was
thought to be a critical stenosis on the right, a marked
stenosis on the left.  CT scan was normal and the patient had
been on aspirin and was then started on Plavix.  He was
referred to [**Hospital3 **] and he was scheduled for a carotid
endarterectomy a week prior to his admission.  On the day of
admission aspirin and Plavix had been stopped in anticipation
of this upcoming surgery, however, while at home patient fell
asleep, complained to his wife of not feeling well and found
him a few hours later slumped over in the bed and felt that
his speech was slurred and not very comprehensible.  He
complained of double vision at the time.  Paramedics reported
that he was moving his extremities, however, developed
right-sided weakness when he arrived at [**Hospital6 5016**].

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Lipitor, Cardia,
hydrochlorothiazide, bronchodilators.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2152**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He had been a smoker for the majority of his
life though only smoking a few cigarettes a day.  He quit in
[**2160-5-15**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was awake and fairly alert with
fluent speech.  No dysarthria.  He repeats well and there is
no anomia.  He follows commands.  Cranial nerves:  Pupils
were small and reactive to light.  Fundi were not seen.  He
had a fairly pronounced vertical gaze palsy.  There was
suggestion of slight lateral rectus weakness.  Visual fields
were full to confrontation testing.  There was mild right
central facial weakness.  The other cranial nerves were
intact.  Motor examination showed no drift and normal
strength to confrontation.  Fine finger movements were intact
but finger-to-nose testing was ataxic, especially on the
right.  The patient's findings were remarkable for a vertical
gaze palsy, maybe a right VI nerve palsy which relates to his
complaint of double vision.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] where he was admitted to the hospital, was started on
anticoagulation and carotid duplex was performed.  He was
admitted to the Vascular Service there and a stroke consult
was done.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count 13.7, hematocrit 34.6,
platelet count 209,000, PT 12.8, PTT 36.4, INR 1.1.  Sodium
137, potassium 4.0, BUN 24, creatinine 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The stroke team recommended stopping
heparin on his admission day and just continuing on aspirin
and Plavix with their considering recent strokes.  The MRI
showed acute stroke in the paramedian thalamus and left of
the midbrain.  He also had small areas of stroke in the
cerebellum.  They recommended a four vessel angiogram and a
carotid endarterectomy on the right carotid and once again
the patient was now on the 11th started on heparin.  The
patient was monitored on the floor where he did continue with
double vision and he was prepped for the carotid artery
endarterectomy.  His repeat carotid ultrasound was completed
which shows a narrowing of 80-99% bilaterally of the tardive
RPPCA suggest proximal disease.  On the 12th the patient
continued with double vision.  His blood pressure was in the
140's to 180's and no other distress.  The patient was made
known to the Neurosurgery Service where he was to have an
angiogram done.  On the [**5-26**] he had an angiogram
which showed greater than 85% left vertebral artery stenosis,
an occluded right vertebral artery.  He had greater than 85%
of the right common carotid bifurcation stenosis, 75%
innominate origin stenosis.  It was noted that patient had a
left groin hematoma after the angiogram where he was
monitored closely post-angiogram.  He was also on telemetry
during this time.  He did end up having an ultrasound of the
groin to rule out pseudo-aneurysm.  The Stroke Team, the
Neurology Team and the Vascular Team decided that the patient
should have a right carotid endarterectomy and then have a
stenting of his left vertebral artery.  On the 13th he did
have the ultrasound of his left groin which showed no
pseudo-aneurysm.  The patient was kept on heparin during this
time.  On the [**5-31**] the patient had a right carotid
endarterectomy done.  He tolerated the procedure well.  On
postoperative day one he was awake, alert and oriented.
Incision was clean, dry and intact.  He was reevaluated by
the Stroke Service the same day.  His blood pressure was
140/46, heart rate 74, respirations 14, temperature 97.8.  At
that point he was transferred back to Neurology Service.  The
patient did receive one unit of red blood cells on the 18th.
It was noted on the 19th that he had slight swelling of the
surgical scar, otherwise the patient was okay.  On the 19th
it was noted that that scar had serous fluid.  No pus or
edema.  The site was monitored by the Vascular Service.  The
patient's pain was under control with Percocet.  A follow-up
ultrasound on the 20th showed a patent right carotid, small
right neck hematoma, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm.  His
left groin hematoma was small, however, improving.  The
patient remained awake, alert and oriented.  His neurological
status was unchanged.  During the postoperative period the
patient was on aspirin and Plavix.  His staples were removed
from the surgical neck site on the 21st.  The site was dry
and intact.  He continued to be followed by Neurology and
Neurosurgery.  Labs on the 23rd showed white count of 7.5,
hematocrit of 39.2, 297,000 for platelets.  On the 25th
patient did have a left vertebroangioplasty and stent.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.  The patient did well with
the procedure.  He woke up awake, alert and oriented.  He had
no drift.  Grasp was [**5-19**] bilaterally.  Lower extremities were
full.  He remained on heparin post stenting at 800 units an
hour and continued on aspirin and Plavix.  The patient was
monitored in the Trauma Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.
He was kept on a Nipride drip to keep his blood pressure less
than 140.  A Rheumatology consult was asked for on the 26th
because of right-sided knee swelling.  There was no erythema,
however, there was increase in warmth.  Patient was thought
to have heterotopic ossification.  It was thought not to be
an infectious process.  Patient was already on aspirin.  They
recommended topical aspirin cream.  The patient was monitored
in the Intensive Care Unit.  On the 27th he continued to need
Nipride to keep his blood pressure less than 140.  He
remained neurologically intact.  Case Management was
following him at this time.  He was moved out of the Unit on
the 28th.  His groin incision was noted to be intact with no
infectious process noted.  No further hematoma.  He remained
neurologically intact.  His blood pressure was well
controlled on oral antihypertensives.  Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy were involved in the patient's care and
they recommended home physical therapy and also for Nursing
to follow up with the patient to check blood pressure.
Rheumatology's final recommendations were prednisone taper,
NSAIDS and some local therapy to his right knee.  Patient was
treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
urinary tract infection diagnosed on the [**6-10**].  He
was started on intravenous vancomycin.  Infectious Disease
recommended that he start on dicloxacillin for one week after
discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted prior to her surgery secondary to being on
Coumadin for her current prosthetic mechanical valves. Her
Coumadin was stopped and she was started on Heparin. She had her
pre-operative work-up done along with a carotid u/s. On [**2-16**] her
INR was at a safe level for surgery and she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a redo Aortic Valve
Replacement with a mehanical valve. Please see op note for
surgical details. She was then brought to the CSRU in stable
condition. Later on op day patient was weaned from sedation and
awoke neurologically intact and was then extubated. She was
weaned from all Inotropes by post op day one and was started on
B blockers and diuretics. She was gently diuresed throughout her
hospital course towards her pre-operative weight. On post-op day
two she was transferred to the cardiac surgery step-down unit.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op
day two. Coumadin was restarted on this day as well. Physical
therapy worked with patient during entire post-op course for
strength and mobility. She appeared to be progressing well
although on post-op day four she had some abdmonial pain, but
abdmonial x-ray was negative. By post-op day five she was
ambulating well and cleared level 5. Her INR was therapeutic and
she was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
follow-up appointments.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Worsening shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 48 year old
female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post
lumpectomy and radiation with a history of two recent
admissions in [**Month (only) 116**] and [**2183-7-10**], for bilateral malignant
pleural effusions and bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2
and Bi-PAP, now presenting with one week of progressive
worsening shortness of breath.  The patient noted, starting
approximately one week ago, progressively worsening shortness
of breath at rest with increasing home O2 requirements.  Two
days prior to admission, the patient presented to the
Emergency Department complaining of shortness of breath,
increased heart rate, decreased O2 saturations in the low
90s.  The patient was evaluated for pulmonary embolism by CT
angiogram which was negative with only slight increase in the
right pleural effusion and atelectatic changes.  The patient
was discharged home with home O2 to follow-up with her
Pulmonologist, Dr. [**Name (NI) **].

On the morning of admission, the patient saw Dr.
[**Name (NI) **], reporting worsening shortness of breath,
increased O2 requirements from 1.5 to 4 liters, decreased O2
saturations from the mid-90s to the low 90s and increased
heart rate above 100.  An echocardiogram of the lungs was
done showing no change in pleural effusions and the patient
was referred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
transthoracic echocardiogram.

The echocardiogram revealed a moderate to large sized
pericardial effusion with a right atrial collapse and a right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
filling and tamponade.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In brief, the patient is a 48 year old
female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post
two recent admissions for bilateral malignant pleural
effusions, bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2 and
bi-PAP, now presenting with progressively worsening shortness
of breath times one week and transthoracic echocardiogram
consistent with pericardial effusion.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient with an echocardiogram
consistent with pericardial effusion.  The patient was taken
to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**8-21**], where the
effusion was tapped and drained for 250 cc. of serosanguinous
fluid.  Right ventricular pressure of 33/15, P- a pressure of
35/17, wedge of 21.  Cardiac output 5.3, cardiac index 3.2.

The drain was subsequently pulled on [**8-23**].  Miss [**Known lastname 16968**] had
an EKG upon admission which showed no evidence of electrical
alternans and EKG upon discharge which also showed no
evidence of electrical alternans.

The house officer was called to see the patient in the
evening of [**8-21**], for chest pain with inspiration.  A
pericardial rub was heard.  An EKG showed some elevation in
PR interval in AVR.

Throughout her hospital course, the patient remained
tachycardic, in the low 100s to 110.  A follow-up
echocardiogram was done revealing normal ejection fraction 45
to 50% and no evidence of pericardial effusion.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of malignant
pleural effusions likely contributing to her symptoms of
shortness of breath.  Dr. [**Name (NI) **] was made aware and
recommended no further intervention at this point.  The
patient was saturating well in the low 90s to 95 range on
four liters of nasal cannula which was decreased to two
liters prior to discharge.  The patient reported subjectively
that her shortness of breath had improved somewhat following
the tap.  She will return home on home O2 and Bi-PAP.

3.  Hematology/Oncology:  The patient has a history of
metastatic breast cancer and malignant bilateral pleural
effusions, now with a new pericardial effusion which is
exudative.  Cytology has been sent to evaluate if this is, in
fact, a malignant pericardial effusion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was made
aware that the patient was hospitalized and involved in her
care during her inpatient stay.  She is scheduled to
follow-up with him on Tuesday, [**8-26**].  She will continue on
Xeloda and pain control with morphine, Percocet, Toradol and
Motrin p.r.n.

The patient was discharged home on [**8-24**], with the following
medications, discharge diagnoses and instructions.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  New pericardial effusion, cytology pending.
2.  Metastatic breast carcinoma with a history of malignant
pleural effusions.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**].
4.  Seasonal allergies.
5.  History of rib fracture.

MEDICATIONS UPON DISCHARGE:
1.  Xeloda 1650 mg twice a day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg p.o. q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  An appointment has been made for Miss [**Known lastname 16968**] to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Hematology/Oncology on Tuesday, [**8-26**], at 02:30 p.m.
2.  It is recommended that the patient have a follow-up
echocardiogram to evaluate any further re-accumulation of
pericardial fluid.
3.  The patient is to call if she has worsening symptoms or
shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain.
4.  The patient is to resume all prior medications.  No new
medications have been added upon this admission.

 EEG:
This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due
to the infrequent right frontocentral slowing. This suggests a
right
frontocentral region of subcortical dysfunction. No epileptiform

features were noted.

MRA/MRV of head
FINDINGS:  There are diffuse areas of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, the largest lesions involving the right anterior
temporal lobe and right inferior frontal lobe with smaller
hemorrhagic lesions noted scattered through the right frontal,
right parietal, right occipital lobe, and left parietal,
temporal, and frontal lobes.  Additional lesions are noted
within the left corpus callosum and right basal ganglia.  Many
of these lesions display mild surrounding edema; however, no
areas of abnormal enhancement are noted throughout the brain
parenchyma.  There is no shift of normally midline structures or
minor or major vascular territorial infarct apparent.  Mild
mucosal thickening is noted within the maxillary sinuses
bilaterally with surrounding osseous structures appearing
unremarkable.  There is a probable small left parietal subgaleal
hematoma.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]
 The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent with
no areas of
significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation. Within the limits
of coverage of study, no sign of an AV malformation is apparent.
 Caliber of the vessel lumens appears smooth and within normal
limits with no irregular stenotic areas identified.

MRV of the brain demonstrates no venous sinus thrombosis.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages many of which are at
the grey white junction with additional lesions noted within the
left corpus callosum and right basal ganglia.  No abnormal areas
of enchancement to suggest underlying focal masses identified.
Mostly unremarkable MRA.  Differential includes vasculitis and
septic emboli including fungal etiologies. Less likely would be
coagulopathy, hemorrhages from underlying trauma, or diffuse
metastatic disease.

TEE
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Overall  left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending,  transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally  normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the  aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears  structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve.


[**2157-3-31**] Testicular USS: Bilateral simple epididymal cysts and
small left-sided hydrocele with no evidence of focal testicular
lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
36 year old with previous episode of head trauma (details
unknown) who presents with confusion and multiple
intraparenchymal hemorrhages. The etiology of lesions remains
unclear.  The initial differential included drugs such as
cocaine, CNS vasculitis, hypertensive crisis, sinus thrombosis,
or multiple mass lesions with hemorrhage. MRI demonstrated L
scalp hematoma, suggestive of trauma. We suspect he may have had
a seizure followed by fall. Thus traumatic precipitant likely
but possible other underlying predisposition for bleeding.

The patient was initially monitored in the Neurology ICU and
transferred to the floor on [**2157-3-28**]. The patient was intially
treated with antibiotics but ceased after cultures were
negative. The patient was treated with dilantin and doses
increased for low level. PLEASE CHECK DILANTIN LEVEL. EEG showed
mild right frontal slowing.

The patient remained difficult to rouse for the first several
days.
The patient became increasingly responsive but remained with
clear cognitive impairment including poor recall for events
despite repeated explanation.  He was abulic, needing
significant prompting to participate in therapy. No other focal
deficits present at discharge. Formal testing of power difficult
due to variable effort but appears full.

PT OT provided.

Review of imaging studies revealed no concensus regarding
etiology of lesions. Cavernous angiomas a possibility but felt
unlikely explanatory of all lesions. MRV was negative for venous
sinus thrombosis.

Drug toxicology screens were negative, but note possible
substances not captured on screening. Echocardiogram to look for
signs of endocarditis/septic emboli  was performed under GA (due
to failure to obtain without sedation) and demonstrated no
source of septic emboli. LP was performed and negative for
cryptococcus, toxoplasmosi, neurocysticercosis.

Inflammatory markers were elevated on admission and trended
down.

Question of possible bleeding metastatic lesions explored with
testicular ultrasound which was normal aside from epipidymal
cysts.  CT abdomen demonstrated hypodensity in the liver likely
due to early fatty infiltration. CT chest suggested small RLL
PE. He was asymptomatic and no further action taken in view of
intracranial bleeding.

There was an episode of urethral bleeding occurred on [**2157-3-31**]
likely associated with recent catheterisation, then settled.

The social work team were involved early on to assist to
communicating with friends and family and patient. Medical team
discussed progress with wife in [**Country 7192**] and obtained phone
consent for procedures (TEE).

Follow up with neurology and PCP has been initiated.  Required
further social work support to pursue free care options and
arrange PCP.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male with a history of diabetes type 2 x5 years complicated
by peripheral neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, and GERD, who
presented to the emergency department on [**2119-10-29**] with a
chief complaint of epigastric pain and burning.  The patient
had exerted himself and had felt fatigued and lightheaded.
At that point in time, he was also short of breath and
slightly diaphoretic.  He had an elevation of his ST
elevations and old Q waves inferiorly on his EKG at that
point in time.  The patient was then cardiac catheterized, at
which time he had a cardiac output of 5.15 with an index of
2.26.  Assessment was severe LMCA three-vessel coronary
artery disease with recent thrombotic occlusion distal RCA,
severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure, and he had a
balloon pump inserted.  It was decided that the patient could
undergo CABG by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He underwent a CABG x4, LIMA to
LAD with a jump graft, ramus, and he was diagnosed with a
PDA.  He had EF preoperatively of 30 percent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history included
diabetes with peripheral neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, coronary
artery disease, and GERD.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  His medications at home included Zocor,
Humulin insulin, aspirin 325 mg, and Lopressor b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] educator, who has
difficulty ambulating at times and uses a cane to walk with
assistance.  He smokes cigars once a week.  He drinks an
occasional glass of wine or scotch every evening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, in the postoperative period,
did quite well within the unit for a brief period of time and
was discharged to the floor when he met criteria.  He
tolerated the procedure quite well, and so he was weaned off
of his Neo immediately postoperatively.  He was on the
insulin drip, and he was started on aspirin and Plavix, and
given Lasix for diuresis.  [**Last Name (un) **] was called, who helped [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult to help manage his diabetes.  The patient had
good pain control.  He had some shortness of breath in the
postoperative period.  However, he was evaluated by Physical
Therapy, and once again, he was ambulating and was able to
recruit and do quite well from a pulmonary perspective, and
by the end of discharge, he was able to ambulate
independently, was able to do stairs, and had his blood sugar
under control.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE/FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  He was given instructions.
He is to follow up in three to four weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was given instructions to see his cardiologist within one
week.  He was given instructions to see his primary care
physician in one week and go over the medications and review
all medications that the patient was currently taking.  The
patient is with an off-pump bypass and therefore should be on
Plavix for three months.

MAJOR DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction, with a recent thrombotic occlusion,
status post coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and blood loss anemia.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 57149**] presented on his
operative day ([**2127-1-14**]) and proceeded to the
Operating Room for coronary artery bypass grafting times four
with a LIMA to the LAD, a saphenous vein graft to the OM, a
saphenous vein graft to the ramus, and a saphenous vein graft
to the PDA.  He also had a mitral valve repair with a 28-mm
[**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band.  Total coronary artery bypass
time was 184 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 155 minutes.
He was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with
a mean arterial pressure of 66, a central venous pressure of
8, in a normal sinus rhythm at a rate 86 on a Neo-Synephrine
drip.  Please see the Operative Report for full details.  The
patient was successfully weaned and extubated on his
operative evening.

On postoperative day one, his intravenous drip medications
were discontinued, and physical therapy was initiated.  On
postoperative day two, his chest tubes were discontinued.
Electrolytes were repleted as necessary, and he was
transferred to the inpatient floor for ongoing recovery and
rehabilitation.  On postoperative day three continued
uneventfully with ongoing physical therapy.  Cardiac pacing
wires were discontinued. Lopressor was increased to 25 mg
p.o. twice daily for heart rate and blood pressure control.
The patient began to be screened for rehabilitation.
Postoperative days five and six also progressed well with a
significant increase in physical therapy level.  It was
decided that Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 57149**] would not need physical therapy.  We
consulted Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 57150**] endocrinologist who recommended
hydrocortisone taper, which we initiated.

On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 57149**] of significant right
knee swallowing and pain, for which an Orthopaedics
consultation was obtained.  Orthopaedics recommended
ambulation with range of motion of the knee.  They stated
there was no evidence for infection.  On postoperative day
eight, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 57149**] reported a significant decrease in pain
with improvement in stiffness with ambulation.  An x-ray of
the knee showed chronic degenerative changes only.

On postoperative day nine, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 57149**] was cleared by
Physical Therapy and found to be safe for discharge home.  He
also had a short burst of atrial fibrillation that
spontaneously converted to a sinus rhythm with no further
episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He was kept in house
overnight to monitor his heart rate.  On postoperative day
ten ([**2127-1-24**]), he was found to be medically ready
for discharge home.

Service:  Neurology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 48749**] is a 49-year-old
man diagnosed with neurosarcoid in a previous neurologic
admission who was recently discharged to rehabilitation on
[**5-11**] after extensive workup for neurosarcoid.  In
rehabilitation he was doing well and was ambulating with and
without a walker.  On [**2173-5-15**], he was prematurely
changed from IV steroids to po Medrol.  Since then, he has
been deteriorating rapidly to the point that he awoke on the
day of admission, and was not able to move his legs at all.

He had breakthrough pain in his lower back and exacerbation
of this allodynia in his feet and legs.  When he was
initially seen in the Emergency Room, he was tearful with
feelings of hopelessness, very upset about his condition.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  His vital signs were stable.  He
is alert, awake, oriented and tearful.  Normal name and
repetition, comprehension was intact.  Months of the year
backwards and forwards were normal.  Cranial nerves were
intact.  Extraocular movements were full.  Face is symmetric.
Tongue was midline.  Palate elevates symmetrically.  Shoulder
shrug was normal.  He had decreased strength in his lower
extremities, 0/5 and full [**5-24**] in his upper extremities.  His
sensory:  Decreased sensation to C6-T1 pin prick in his upper
extremities and deep tendon reflexes were 0/4 in the upper
extremities, trace brachioradialis.  Proprioception was
decreased in his fingers, wrist, and elbow at the level of
the shoulders.  In his lower extremities, he had severe
decrease in sensation, decreased pin prick, light touch,
vibratory, and cold from T7 down, worse on the left side.

He was seen and admitted for acute worsening of his lower
extremity weakness.  He decided to order a MRI of the spine
which is unchanged from before, and we changed the steroids
to 1 gram IV q day, Solu-Medrol x5 days, and had Rheumatology
consult to discuss these use of other immunomodulatory
agents.  He had severe pain and at first we increased his
methadone and Neurontin, and started a Morphine PCA pump.  We
had him on pantoprazole GI prophylaxis, and watched him
closely on the neurologic service.

Over the coming days with his movement and pain was somewhat
better controlled, Rheumatology saw him and agreed with
Solu-Medrol, and then felt that he would also benefit from
steroids after that as well.  He was watched closely on the
Neurologic service, and PCA pump was working well to control
his pain.

On [**5-20**], he was found by the Neurology Service to be
minimally responsive.  He was given naloxone with much
benefit.  He continued to be less responsive and was not
following commands.  We transferred him to the Intensive Care
Unit for further observation on [**5-20**] as well as a STAT
electroencephalogram was performed.  This
electroencephalogram showed a mild encephalopathy, but was
negative for seizures.  He was monitored and his respiratory
distress was watched closely.  Initially, his respirations
were [**6-27**], however, in the coming hours, he improved and was
able to breathe in regular rate 12-15 breathes/minute, and
his neurologic status improved.  It was felt that his acute
change in mental status was attributed to his increased pain
medications especially his PCA pump.

He was transferred back to the floor the following day.  IV
steroids and Solu-Medrol were continued, and a full course
was given in five days.  Again Rheumatology recommended to
continue Imuran 50 mg q day as well as continue 1.2 mg of
Medrol IV divided in [**Hospital1 **] dosages.  They also recommended that
infliximab may be used 5 mg/kg IV x1, and after the IV
steroids were completed, and then two weeks later as well as
six weeks after that.  I discussed this with the entire
Neurology team as well as other consulting services.

We also discussed the issue of a positive PPD with Infectious
Disease and given that we were giving him infliximab and high
dosed steroids, we may need to be more aggressive with his
anti-TB prophylactic treatment.  They felt that INH was
sufficient and he would just have to be monitored closely.
He was also given a bowel regimen of Senna, Dulcolax, and
Colace, and he was able to control his bowels as well.

He was found to have a urinary tract infection with some
blood in his urine, and he was started on Levaquin 500 mg po
q day.  He will continue this as an outpatient as well.  His
pain was controlled on his gabapentin, nortriptyline,
Percocet, and methadone and his leg shaking was controlled on
increasing doses of primidone tapered up to 225 mg po tid.

Over the few days before his discharge, he had increasing leg
strength, and was able to abduct his legs for the first time
since admission.  He remains clinically stable.  We
discontinued the Foley the day prior to admission, and he
urinated nine hours later 500 cc.  He continued to have
hyperesthesia in his bilateral lower extremities and his
strength was returning slowly.  He was deemed stable for
discharge to rehabilitation on [**5-26**] with followup in the
[**Hospital 878**] Clinic as well as followup in the Pheresis Unit at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital for his infliximab treatment.  He was
seen and followed up with Psychiatry and his mood was better.
He stated he was hanging in there and doing well.  They felt
that we should continue with Celexa 40 mg and consider using
Seroquel 25-50 mg q hs for sleep instead of Ambien.

On discharge, he was much improved.  Social Work as well as
other services met with him.  Social Work helped him with
[**Social Security Number 48750**]social security disability benefit forms, and relayed
information.  Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy were
.................... for rehabilitation.

range from .20-.5 cm to .62 cm.
Echo [**11-16**]: PRE-BYPASS: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild(1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. POST-BYPASS: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.
No evidence of aortic dissection post decannulation. The mitral
regurgitation may have been slightly improved. CXR [**11-22**]:

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 41483**] was transferred from OSH to
[**Hospital1 18**] for surgical care. Upon admission he underwent all
pre-operative work-up, including vein mapping and carotid
ultrasound. He remained medically managed, including Heparin
gtt, for several days awaiting Plavix load from cardiac cath to
washout. On [**11-16**] he was brought to the operating room where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see
operative report for surgical details. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. He remained intubated until
post-op day one, when he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On this day attempted
cardioversion was performed d/t atrial fibrillation and was then
paced at 90. But later he then converted back to AFIB. Of note,
he was in Afib prior to surgery d/t hyperthyroidism. On post-op
day two beta blockers and diuretics were started. He was gently

Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
male with prior cardiac history significant for coronary
artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, history of
congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy and aortic
regurgitation.  The patient's aortic insufficiency has
progressed from moderate to severe over the last several
years.  The patient claimed that he had a few symptoms.
However, his wife stated that he has had more dyspnea on
exertion and fatigue recently.  The patient smokes
approximately one pack a day.  He is overweight.  The patient
denies any chest pain.  The patient also has a history of
sleep apnea.  A recently performed echocardiogram showed
moderate severe aortic insufficiency with ejection fraction
of approximately 25%.  A repeat cardiac catheterization
performed on [**2131-9-3**] showed one vessel branch coronary artery
disease, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, severe
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild
biventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary
arterial diastolic hypertension.  At the time, the left
ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be 29%.  Given
the patient's worsening symptoms, the decision was made to
proceed with an aortic valve replacement as a long term
solution.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  [**6-24**] echocardiogram with ejection fraction of 20% to 25%
with multiple wall motion abnormalities including apical
akinesis, anteroseptal hypokinesis/akinesis, inferior
hypokinesis/akinesis as well as lateral hypokinesis/akinesis.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20% to
29%.  History of myocardial infarction.
3.  Aortic insufficiency
4.  Cardiomyopathy
5.  Coronary artery disease
6.  Sleep apnea

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No known surgical history.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg po q day
2.  Lipitor 20 mg po q day
3.  Mavik 4 mg po q day
4.  Lasix 40 mg po q day
5.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q day

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile, heart rate 70 and sinus rhythm, blood
pressure 130/81.
GENERAL:  Alert and oriented in no apparent distress, obese
white male.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Within normal limits.  No
evidence of jugular venous distention.  No evidence of
bruits.
PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Sinus rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur and [**3-28**] diastolic
murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Obese, soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, pulses present and are palpable
bilaterally.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 30.5, white
blood cell count 10.2, platelets 122.  PTT 35.2, PT 12.2, INR
1.0.  Glucose 119, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9.  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.7.

IMAGING:  Preoperative chest x-ray was within normal limits.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to
cardiac surgery service.  Given symptomatic aortic
insufficiency and also history of congestive heart failure,
it was decided that a surgical intervention would be
appropriate.  On [**2131-10-31**], the patient underwent aortic valve
replacement with a 23 mm Carbomedics mechanical valve.  The
procedure was without any complications.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  Please see the full operative
note for details.  The patient remained intubated and was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management
in stable condition.  The patient was extubated on the same
day.  His oxygenation remained good.  He was making adequate
urine.

Postoperatively, the patient's arterial blood gas was pH
7.38, PCO2 of 34, PO2 of 110.  His hematocrit was stable at
30.5.  The patient was further diuresed.  He was transferred
to the regular floor on postoperative day 1 in good
condition.  The patient continued to have excellent
oxygenation on minimal supplemental oxygen.  Physical therapy
was consulted which followed the patient throughout his
hospitalization and then officially cleared him to go home.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin was restarted.  Given the
presence of a mechanical valve, an INR of 2.5 to 3 was set as
the goal.

The patient remained afebrile.  He remained in sinus rhythm.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His pacing
wires were removed on postoperative day 3.  His urine
catheter was removed on postoperative day 2.  The patient was
also started on intravenous heparin on postoperative day 3
given slow rise in the NR level.  The patient was ambulating
without assistance.  The patient was continued to be diuresed
with Lasix.  He had 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
His incision was clean, dry and intact throughout this
hospitalization course.  On the date of discharge, his INR
was 1.9.  The patient was discharged to home on postoperative
day 6.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 5.7, her hematocrit was 33.2, and her
platelets were 199.  Her INR was 1.1.  Sodium was 136,
potassium was 3.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 25,
blood urea nitrogen was 8, creatinine was 0.5, and blood
glucose was 92.  Liver function tests were within normal
limits.  Urinalysis was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 57 beats per minute.

A chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary processes.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the
patient was a direct admission to the operating room on [**4-1**] where she underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair
via a right mid axillary mini-anterior thoracotomy with a
28-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] angioplasty.  Please see the Operative Report
for full details.

In summary, the patient had a minimally invasive mitral valve
repair.  Her bypass time was 130 minutes with a cross-clamp
time of 110 minutes.  She tolerated the operation well and
was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's
mean arterial pressure was 74 with a central venous pressure
of 6.  She was in a sinus rhythm at 89 beats per minute.  She
had a Levophed infusion at 0.3 mcg/kg per minute and propofol
at 20 mcg/kg per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  She had no other
events on operative day.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to require a
Levophed infusion for blood pressure support which was
titrated as tolerated.  Her Swan-Ganz catheter was removed on
postoperative day two.  The patient had weaned to off the
Levophed infusion, and she was transferred to the floor for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Additionally, on postoperative day two, the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was removed.  Over the next several days, the patient
had an uneventful hospitalization.

Once on the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff
and the Physical Therapy staff, the patient's activity level
was advanced.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospitalization.

On postoperative day four, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready to be discharged to home.  At that time,
the patient's physical examination was as follows.  Vital
signs revealed her temperature was 99, her heart rate was 92
(sinus rhythm), her blood pressure was 104/68, her
respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on
room air.  Her weight preoperatively was 59 kilograms, at
discharge was 66.7 kilograms.

Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 7.7, her
hematocrit was 23.1, and her platelets were 129.  Sodium was
137, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 31,
blood urea nitrogen was 8, creatinine was 0.5, and her blood
glucose was 99.

Physical examination revealed she was alert and oriented
times three.  She moved all extremities.  She followed
commands.  Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  First heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Right thoracotomy incision with
Steri-Strips, opened to air, clean and dry.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg every day.
2.  Niferex 150 mg mouth once per day.
3.  Vitamin C 500 mg twice per day.
4.  Toprol-XL 12.5 mg once per day.
5.  Levoxyl 50 mcg by mouth once per day.
6.  Colace 100 mg twice per day.
7.  Lasix 20 mg once per day (times two weeks).
8.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq once per day (times two weeks).
9.  Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg q.4-6h. as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair via a
right thoracotomy.
2.  Hypothyroidism.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a chest x-ray
that showed no acute process, no suspicious nodules.  EKG on
[**2154-12-25**], sinus bradycardia, rate 49, inferior
lateral flat T-waves.  On [**2154-10-1**], CT of the thorax was
stable, no lesions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the transplant
service.  He was made NPO after midnight.  IV fluid was
started.  Lab work was sent off to use preop for the OR.
Labs preop:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 38, platelet count
38, fibrinogen 135.  Coags:  PT 17, PTT 37, INR 1.6.
Creatinine 1, BUN 19, sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride
105, CO2 26.  The UA was negative.

He was taken to the OR on [**1-18**] for orthotopic liver
transplant.  Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], co-surgeon was
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].  EBL was 2 liters.  He was replaced with 5
liters of crystalloid, 6 units of FFP, 6 units of packed red
blood cells, 3 bags of platelets and 1 bag of cryoglobulin.
Please see operative report for details.  The patient was
intubated and taken to the surgical intensive care unit in
critical, but stable condition.

He was given induction immunosuppression of 500 mg of Solu-
Medrol, 1 gram of CellCept intraop.  In the SICU, his
hematocrits were followed closely.  He was replaced with IV
fluid.  Hematocrit was 30.6.  He was weaned and extubated.
His LFTs trended down.  Properatively, his AST was 1463, ALT
1116, alkaline phos 55, total bilirubin 3.9, and an amylase
of 279.  On postoperative day 2, his AST was 476, ALT 746,
alkaline phos 56, and a total bilirubin of 1.2.  A duplex
ultrasound of the liver demonstrated perihepatic ascites.
Portal veins and hepatic veins were visualized with normal
direction of flow, poorly dopplered hepatic artery waveforms
were noted, likely secondary to technical limitations.  A
repeat ultrasound was done on postoperative day 2.  This
demonstrated appropriate waveforms and directionality of flow
within the portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries.
His LFTs continued to trend down.  Vital signs were stable.
His preop weight was 113.  On postoperative day 1, his weight
was 130.5.  He began on IV Lasix and his weight trended down
and achieved a weight of 116.7 no postoperative day 14.

His hematocrit trended down to 23.5 on postoperative day 9.
He received 3 units of packed red blood cells.  A repeat
hematocrit was 26.9.  He received another unit of packed red
blood cells as well as 1 unit of platelets for a platelet
count of 74.  Post-platelet transfusion was 114 and a post-
hematocrit was 32.1.  His hematocrit remained in the range of
28 to 29 for the remainder of his hospital course.  He did
undergo abdominal CT with and without contrast to evaluate
for any bleeding.  The CT demonstrated no cause for drop in
hematocrit.  There was moderate hepatic artery stenosis
noted.  There was narrowing of the portal vein at the area of
the anastomosis as well as mild stenosis at the origin of the
right renal artery.  A small amount of ascites and
perihepatic fluid was noted.  There were multiple low
attenuation areas in the transplanted liver likely
representing simple cysts.

When the patient was in the SICU, as he awakened, he
complained of pain control.  Patient was on Methadone 145 mg
p.o. q. d. at home and he had not been on this as of
postoperative day 2.  Dilaudid 2 mg IV q. 1 hour was
ineffective in relieving the patient's pain, so the Dilaudid
was increased to 4 mg IV q. 1 to 2 hours.  Methadone was
restarted.  The patient was started on clear liquids.  He
tolerated this without incident.  His blood sugars were
elevated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained.  He was placed on
an insulin sliding scale to achieve normalization of blood
glucoses.  He was hypertensive while in the SICU.  He was
given Hydralazine and Lopressor.  Blood pressure improved and
ranged between 130s to 140s down to 90 to 100 systolic.
Lopressor was changed to p.o.  His Solu-Medrol was tapered
per protocol and he was started on 20 mg on postoperative day
7 of Prednisone and he remained on CellCept 1 gram b.i.d.
throughout this hospital course.  Prograf was started on
postoperative day 2 at 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Prograf was adjusted
and titrated to levels.  Prograf level increased to 18.9 on
postoperative day 8.  His dose was decreased and he was
stabilized on 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a Prograf level of 9 to
14 on 2 mg twice a day.

He was transferred to the medical/surgical unit where he
continued to recover slowly.  Pain control continued to be an
issue.  Consult was obtained.  Recommendations included
continuation of Methadone 145 mg q. a.m. and adjusting
Dilaudid p.o. to 8 to 16 mg p.o. q. 2 hours p.r.n.  For the
remainder of this hospital course, his pain continued to be
monitored.  He complained primarily of right upper quadrant
discomfort.  Towards the end of his hospital stay, his pain
was lessened and he was receiving 4 mg p.o. approximately 4
times a day.

A physical therapy consult was obtained.  PT worked with him
to ambulate.  Given his deconditioning, it was recommended
that he continue home PT.  He has 2 [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains; #1
was discontinued on postoperative day 5 and #2 JP drain
continued to drain approximately 290 cc of serosanguineous
fluid.  On postoperative day 7, he was started on IV
Vancomycin for some erythema around the incision at the left
lower quadrant.  This erythema resolved towards the end of
the hospital course and Vancomycin was stopped.  His white
blood cell count remained in the 4.7 to 6.6 range.  The
second JP was removed.  His LFTs continued to decrease.  He
was tolerating a regular diet and needed a lot of
encouragement to ambulate.

On postoperative day 9, patient complained of right neck
discomfort.  His right IJ site appeared mildly edematous.  A
carotid ultrasound was done.  This demonstrated no
pseudoaneurysm.  There was also noted of a right IJ partially
occlusive clot.  He was not started on Heparin or Coumadin.
The [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained.  He was maintained on a
sliding scale insulin regimen for moderately elevated blood
sugars.  He required a minimal amount of regular insulin and
this was tapered off towards the end of the hospital stay.

He was discharged home on postoperative day 15 in stable
condition.  His LFTs had trended down with an AST of 49, ALT
217, alkaline phos 102, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin of 3.1.
His creatinine was 1.1, BUN 21, white blood cell count 6.6
and a hematocrit of 29.4.  He was urinating independently
without any difficulty.  He was tolerating p.o. well.  Blood
pressure ranged between 118/72 to 135/78.  He was afebrile.
He was out of bed ambulating independently.  Visiting nurse
services were set up for medication management, AcuCheks and
wound assessment.  The plan was for him to return to the
[**Hospital 2514**] clinic on Monday, [**2155-2-3**], for assessment for
continuation of Methadone maintenance.  [**Hospital 2514**] clinic was
the Discovery House [**Hospital 2514**] Clinic.  That telephone number
was 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 46538**].  He was discharged home in stable
condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a
54 year old gentleman with a history of a [**2143**]5 feet with
no loss of consciousness, complained of headache on [**7-14**],
and went to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Computerized tomography scan
of the head showed large right subdural hematoma,
longitudinally covering the whole hemisphere with about 2 cm
plus substantial midline shift and complete effacement of the
right lateral ventricle.  The patient was sedated and
intubated and sent to [**Hospital6 256**]
for further management.  On arrival the patient's pupils were
less than 2 mm and nonreactive.  The right was 5 mm and
nonreactive.  The patient was taken emergently to the
Operating Room for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent
evacuation of a right frontal subdural hematoma without
intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively the patient
was intubated off of Propofol and attempted to open his eyes
to voice, moving all four extremities spontaneously.  After
attempts to localize the noxious stimuli, lower extremities
withdraw to pain.  His blood pressure was kept less than 120
with Nipride.  He continued on Propofol.  His pCO2 was kept
in the 30 to 35 range.  He had his thoracolumbosacral spine
cleared.  His cervical spine was unable to be cleared at that
time and he has remained in a hard collar.  On [**7-16**], he
had a repeat head computerized tomography scan which showed
post surgical changes and a small amount of  subdural
hematoma still visible.  His cervical spine showed
degenerative changes and spinal stenosis.  He was extubated
also on [**7-16**].  He was following commands.  He had right
drift in the upper extremity, but moving all his other
extremities spontaneously.  On [**7-18**], the patient had
another repeat head computerized tomography scan which showed
stable appearance of the remaining subdural hematoma.  The
patient was withdrawing all four extremities, less on the
right lower extremity, somewhat sleepy.  The patient was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2197-7-20**] and remained
in stable condition.  He had a swallow evaluation which he
passed, feeding tube was removed and he was able to start
taking p.o. intake.  He had flexion extension films done of
the cervical spine which were inadequate and needed to be
repeated.  Results of that are pending.  He has been followed
by physical therapy and occupational therapy and found to
require acute rehabilitation.  He is awake, alert and
following commands, moving all extremities.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d., hold for heart rate less
   than 60, blood pressure less than 110.
2. Nystatin oral suspension 5 cc p.o. q.i.d.
3. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours.
4. Famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q. day.
6. Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q. day.
7. Clonidine patch one patch q. day, q. Monday.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  Vital signs were stable at
the time of discharge.

FOLLOW UP:  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one month
with a repeat head computerized tomography scan.

Service:  NSU

ADDENDUM:  On [**2197-7-28**], the patient continued to improve
neurologically.  His vital signs were stable.  He was awake
and alert and oriented x3.  He exhibited no pronator drift.
His grip and IPs were full.  His x-ray showed a C2-3
subluxation on flexion and extension films.

ASSESSMENT:  He was neurologically stable and is ordered to
stay in a hard collar for now.  The following day, on
[**2197-7-29**], the patient continued to show improvement.  He
was to continue with physical therapy and occupational
therapy.  He is to begin ambulating and is to follow up his
flexion and extension films of the cervical vertebrae in 2
weeks, and rehabilitation planning should be started.  On
[**2197-8-1**], the patient was discharged to home with services.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He is to take all medications as
prescribed, keep all followup appointments.  He is to keep
wearing the cervical collar until he has followup x-rays and
sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**].  He is to walk only with assistance.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  Right subdural hematoma status post
surgical evacuation of right subdural hematoma.  He also has
a cervical spine subluxation with neck flexion.  He is
recommended to followup.  He is to get repeat cervical spine
flexion and extension x-rays in 2 weeks.  He is to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 2 weeks, [**2197-8-18**], at 9 a.m. to be preceded
by flexion and extension x-rays of his cervical spine at 8
a.m.

MAJOR SURGICAL PROCEDURE WHILE IN THE HOSPITAL:  Surgical
evacuation of right subdural hematoma.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  His discharge condition is improved
though still with some gait unsteadiness requiring
supervision.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Oxycodone and acetaminophen 5/325 mg tablet, 1-2 tablets
   p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.  He is dispensed 40 tablets with 0
   refills.
2. He is also prescribed Lopressor 50 mg tablet.  He is to
   take 0.5 tablets p.o. b.i.d.  He is to hold if his heart
   rate is less than 60 or his blood pressure is less than
   100.  He is dispensed 30 tablets with 2 refills.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient's condition at the time of
discharge is stable.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 54 year old female with a history of
hypertension and recent discharge from [**Hospital 1514**] hospital 14 days
ago with a Type B aortic dissection treated medically who
presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**3-29**] with persistent nausea and
vomiting and intensified back pain radiating down her spine. At
[**Hospital1 **], a CT-A was performed which showed no PE and a
dissection extending below the diaphragm. The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

The patient's symptoms began 3 weeks ago with band-like chest
pain radiating to her back with diaphoresis. She was found at
[**Location (un) 1514**] to have a Type B dissection (unknown extension) and was
admitted to the ICU and discharged 14 days ago on PO labetalol,
nifedipine, protonix and clonidine (doses unknown). Since her
discharge, the patient has been feeling increasingly weak with
intermittent nausea and bilious vomiting and has been unable to
tolerate a PO diet at home. She also noted hematemesis within
the past few days. She denies any blood in her stool recently
but notes green diarrhea x 14 days with a history of blood in
her stool at [**Location (un) 1514**]. The patient states that she has been
compliant with all her medications at home. She states her back
pain recently intensified as well.

At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was having bilious emesis with specks of
blood with a blood pressure of 160 systolic. She was placed on a
labetalol drip at 1 mg but then developed sinus bradycardia to
the 50s. As a result, nipride was started and was at 0.1 on
exam. The blood pressure in her left arm was 100/58 and in the
right, 160/68 with a HR of 79 on nipride alone. The patient was
pain-free on exam.

A repeat CT chest and A/P was performed that showed a large,
well-perfused false lumen extending distal to the left
subclavian with the left renal artery and inferior mesenteric
artery branching from the false lumen. The superior mesenteric
artery did extend from the true lumen, however, is partially
occluded by the intimal flap. There was no bowel wall
thickening. The dissection extends inferiorly into the bilateral
external iliacs into the groin.

Vascular and cardiac surgery was consulted. Vascular surgery
decided to monitor medically for now.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension

Social History:
The patient works as a manager for [**State 19827**] Fried Kitchen. She
admits to smoking 1 ppd x 38 years but has not smoked since her
admission to [**Location (un) 1514**] 3 weeks ago. She admits to a history of
heavy alcohol use in the past x 1 year with 4-5 beer/hard liquor
4 x a week. She denies any history of illicit drug use. The
patient is not married and has four children and lives alone.

Pertinent Results:

ECHO [**2144-3-29**]

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Symmetric LVH. Mild regional LV systolic
dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta.  Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma
in aortic arch. Moderately  dilated descending aorta Descending
aorta intimal flap/aortic dissection. Flow  in false lumen.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify  I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored  by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for  the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). Local anesthesia was provided by benzocaine topical
spray. No TEE related complications. The patient appears to be
in sinus rhythm. Results were  personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
orthrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the  right atrium/right atrial
appendage. There is symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy. LV
systolic function appears mildly depressed with
inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma
in the  ascending aorta and aortic arch without evidence of
aortic dissection. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately
dilated. A mobile density is seen in  descending aorta
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. There  is
flow in the large false lumen. There is a
fenestration/communication  between the true/false lumen at
approx. 35 cm from the incisors that may  represent the point of
initial intimal tear. The dissection extends proximally  and
ends at the takeoff of the left subclavian artery without
compromising  subclavian flow. There is partial thombosis of the
false lumen just distal to  the left subclavian artery. The
dissection extends distally to abdominal aorta  and extends
beyond what was visualized (50 cm from the incisors).The true
lumen is significantly narrowed at times but distal flow is not
clearly  compromised. Both coronary artery ostia were visualized
in their appropriate  orientation with normal color doppler
signal (pulse wave doppler was not  performed).The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Thoracic aortic dissection limited to the descending
aorta (type B). Large false lumen that is partially thrombosed
proximally. There is no clear evidence of distal flow compromise
but clinical correlation is suggested.

RENAL U.S.  [**2144-3-29**]

Reason: AORTIC DISSECTION, ASSESS RENAL FLOW

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old woman with extensive descending dissection to
external iliacs bilaterally with left renal off of false lumen
now with decreased urine output
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:Please assess renal flow
INDICATION: Assess renal vascular flow, s/p aortic dissection.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10.3 cm. The left
kidney measures 10.3 cm. No hydronephrosis or stones. No
perinephric fluid collection identified.

DUPLEX ULTRASOUND: Color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the
renal vasculature. Normal flow is demonstrated in the right and
left renal arteries. Normal waveforms are identified within the
left and right main renal arteries.

IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound. Normal flow and waveforms
are demonstrated in the main renal arteries bilaterally.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2144-3-29**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old woman with Type B aortic dissection by CT from OSH
but scan did not find distal extent.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval extent of dissection

INDICATION: Type B aortic dissection by CT from outside hospital
but scan did not find distal extent. Evaluate dissection.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest were
obtained without contrast. Subsequently, following the
administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast, contiguous axial
images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained
during opacification of the aorta and its branches. Multiplanar
reconstructions were obtained.

CTA OF THE CHEST: There is a type B aortic dissection present.
The dissection begins just distal to the left subclavian artery
origin of the aorta. There is a large false lumen seen to the
left and a smaller true lumen. There is a fenestration in the
intimal flap seen on series 3, image 18. Thus, the true and
false lumens communicate. The celiac axis arises from the true
lumen, though the intimal flap is abutting the origin of the
celiac axis. The dissection extends into the celiac axis. The
SMA similarly arises from the true lumen, though the intimal
flap is protruding into the ostium of the origin of the SMA. The
dissection extends into the SMA and the SMA is quite small. The
right renal artery arises from the true lumen, and the intimal
flap extends slightly into the ostium of the right renal artery.
This is best seen on series 4, image 295. The left renal artery
arises from the false lumen. More inferiorly, the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arises
from the false lumen. The dissection extends into both common
iliac arteries. The dissection extends into the common external
and iliac arteries on the right side. The dissection also
extends into the external and internal iliac arteries on the
left side. The intimal flap extends through the right external
iliac artery and is seen clearly to about the level of the
acetabulum. Beyond this point, it is difficult to assess. The
intimal flap is no longer seen definitely in the mid portion of
the left external iliac artery. There is low-density material
fill to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The dissection
does not clearly extend into the left subclavian artery.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is atelectasis
within the lungs dependently. No consolidations. There are very
small pleural effusions at the bases posteriorly. No pericardial
effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
pancreas, and adrenals are normal. The kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete normally, despite the left renal
artery arising from the false lumen. No free air or free fluid
within the abdomen. The noncontrast opacified loops of bowel are
containing some fluid but are otherwise unremarkable.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The bladder, uterus, rectum, and
sigmoid are unremarkable. Within the cecum, there is a rounded
enhancing structure of unclear etiology. No pathologically
enlarged lymph nodes within the pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic
lesions.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the
anatomy and pathology in this case.

IMPRESSION: Extensive type B aortic dissection. The dissection
arises distal to the left subclavian artery. There is a
fenestration between the true and false lumen. The celiac and
SMA arise from the true lumen, though the dissection extends
into these vessels. The residual SMA is quite small. The right
renal artery arises from the true lumen and the left renal
artery from the false. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arises from the false lumen. The
dissection extends into the external and internal iliac arteries
bilaterally.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 54 year old female with a history of HTN, Type
B descending dissection who presents with persistent
nausea/vomiting with possible left renal and superior mesenteric
artery involvement.

1. Type B dissection
- Appreciate vascular and cardiac surgery input. The patient is
at higher risk for bowel ischemia given the nature of the near
occlusion of the SMA by the intimal flap. In addition, there is
potential renal involvement of the left renal artery as it
already extends from a large false lumen. At this time, the
patient will be medically managed with a nipride drip with a
goal SBP 100-120. Labetalol gtt was attempted in the ER without
success and was limited by sinus bradycardia to the 50s.
- We will continue to monitor for signs of renal failure or
bowel ischemia.
- On [**2144-3-29**], the patient's urine output dropped to 15-20 cc/hr
from 60-70. A stat renal ultrasound with doppler flow was
obtained to evalaute renal perfusion in the setting of a left
renal artery previously seen to be coming from the false lumen.
In addition, her lactate was checked TID which rose from 0.7 to
1.1 on [**2144-3-29**]. Vascular and cardiac surgery were called and
made aware. Then the patient developed severe left arm pain and
concern was that her dissection was extending proximally.
- On [**2144-3-30**] the pt went to the angiography suite and underwent
successful fenestration of her abdominal aortic false lumen, and
fenestration and stenting of her SMA.
- [**2064-4-9**]-- Pt underwent stenting of both renal arteries as the
aortic dissection had spread and had stenosed both renal
arteries.
[**2144-4-16**]-- Abdominal aorta and bilateral pelvic runoff, aortic
dissection and fenestration, removal and replacement of right
renal stent, intravascular ultrasound of aorta.
[**2144-4-22**]-- Pts. bowel ischemia worsened, went to the OR for
exploratory laparotomy, ascending aorta to superior mesenteric
artery bypass, Resection of distal ileum, right colon, and
transverse colon, Ileostomy, and subtotal colectomy and small
bowel resection.
Over the next week the pt underwent several
laparotomies/washouts and revisions of her ileostomy. Finally, a
GJ tube was placed for enteral feeding.
[**2144-6-29**]-- Pt underwent a CT angiogram which demonstrated a
widely patent sma graft, and a stable aortic dissection.

2. CHF, EF unknown
- The patient has 10 cm JVP on exam with no known EF. Meanwhile,
we will keep the patient euvolemic. An echo was perfomed on
[**2144-3-29**] which showed an inferior wall that was hypokinetic and
there was concern that her right coronary artery was being
affected by a dissection. As a result, a TEE was to be performed
on [**2144-3-29**] and cardiac surgery was made aware.

3. Transaminitis
- The patient reports a history of hepatitis that was contracted
from eating food in a hospital during her delivery in [**2109**]. We
will recheck a hepatitis panel and trend her LFTs. We do not
know her baseline. If her LFTs continue to climb, we may
consider a RUQ ultrasound with concern for ischemia with known
celiac involvement.

4. Coffee-ground emesis
- The patient will remain NPO for now with IV protonix [**Hospital1 **]. The
patient is hemodynamically stable at present. We will check her
Hct TID for now.

Service:  Cardiothoracic

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is
an 85 year old male with known coronary artery disease and
history of myocardial infarction in [**2089**] who presented to an
outside hospital with a complaint of shortness of breath and
dyspnea on exertion.  An echocardiogram at the outside
hospital demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45% with mitral
regurgitation 2 to 3+ as well as inferior, posterior
hypokinesis.  He had computerized tomographic angiography
which demonstrated no pulmonary embolus.  Dobutamine stress
demonstrated large anterior apical inferior, posterior and
lateral reversible defects.  Chest x-ray also done at the
outside hospital showed right middle lobe infiltrates.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, right middle lobe
infiltrates, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, gout,
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, persistent elevated

ALLERGIES:  He is allergic to Codeine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of
admission revealed vital signs with heartrate of 74, blood
pressure 134/67, respiratory rate 18.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat, pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes moist, full
benches.  Neck, no lymphadenopathy and no jugulovenous
distension.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 with
systolic ejection murmur best heard in the lower sternal
border, III/VI.  Abdomen is nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds, obese.  Groin, no bruits, no bleeding.
Extremities, positive edema.  Pulses are palpable
bilaterally.  Skin is ecchymotic at intravenous sites.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of transfer
revealed white count 8.2, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 195,
sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 32,
BUN 18, creatinine 1.3, glucose 118, CPK prior to admission
on [**462-12-13**], on [**413-12-14**], on [**394-12-17**]
and on [**394-12-19**].  Troponins are all less than .04
except for on [**12-13**], they were 0.05.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory, please see catheterization report
or full details.  In summary the catheterization report
showed normal left main with left anterior descending 80%
occlusion, circumflex 70% occlusion and right coronary artery
totally occluded.  Post cardiac catheterization,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.  In summary, the
patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a
later date following a complete workup including carotid
dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to
assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral
regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe
infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.  The
patient was maintained on the Medical Service prior to his
surgery during his preoperative testing.  On [**12-20**], he
experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  At that time he was seen by the
electrophysiology service who recommended that the patient be
loaded with amiodarone and started on heparin.  On [**12-23**] the patient complained of abdominal pain.  Following his
complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of
consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he
had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
During that time he was pulseless.  He did rule in for a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac
arrest.  A temporary pacing wire was placed and he was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
monitoring prior to his coronary artery bypass grafting.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was further complicated by an
episode of ventricular tachycardia during which the patient
was pulseless.  This occurred on [**12-26**].  The patient
was shocked out of the ventricular tachycardia with 300
joules followed by ventricular pacing with the temporary wire
he had in place.  The following morning, [**12-27**], the
patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
please see the operation report for full details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial
pressure was 70, central venous pressure was 12, he was
ventricularly paced at a rate of 70.  He had a propofol at 20
mcg/kg/min and Neosynephinre at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.  The patient
did well in the immediately postoperative period.  He
remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean
arterial pressure greater than 70.  He remained intubated
throughout postoperative day #1 in anticipation of an
angioplasty to be done on postoperative day #1.

As stated, the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1.  At that
time his coronary arteries were again studied.  The
catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have
an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex
and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right
coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via
left to right collaterals.  His left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending was widely patent with normal
flow.  At that time he underwent an angioplasty of his obtuse
marginal 1 lesion.  The lesion was crossed and stented with
no residual lesion.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well, please see the catheterization report for full details.
Following the catheterization and stenting the patient was
transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival the
patient's sedation was discontinued.  He was weaned from his
ventilator and ultimately extubated.  For the next 48 hours
the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, monitoring his hemodynamic stability and his
respiratory status.  On postoperative day #4 the patient was
transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient remained on the Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor.  His
activity level was slowly increased with the aid of physical
therapy and the nursing staff.  He continued to be followed
by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10
he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he
underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted
cardioverter defibrillator placement.  Please see
electrophysiology study report for full details.  The patient
remained on Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor for two additional
days at which time he was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs temperature
97.7, heartrate 67, ventricularly paced, blood pressure
145/70, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters.  Weight preoperatively is 125 kg, at discharge is
121.8 kg.  Laboratory data on the day of discharge is white
count 9.5, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 273, PT 14, PTT 28.7,
INR 1.4.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, carbon
dioxide 31, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, glucose 100.  On physical
examination he is alert and oriented times three, moves all
extremities and is conversant.  Respiratory, diffuse rhonchi
bilaterally, no rales.  Heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm.
Sternum is stable.  Incision with steri-strips, open to air,
clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm with 2 to 3+ edema and
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  The patient does complain of
pain in the right groin including the upper leg.  This pain
was noted preoperatively.  He had bilateral groin ultrasounds
which were negative for pseudoaneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to Trauma surgery with multiple facial
fractures, as well as severe trauma to the left eye.
Neurosurgery, Opthomology and Plastics all contributed to the
patients care.  The patient developed a CSF leak that was
followed by Neurosurgery that eventually subsided.  Nuerosurgery
also followed the patient for a questionable C4-C6 ligamentous
injury for which he was put in a cervical collar. Opthomology
took the patient to the OR for Left globe exploration, they
found no globe rupture but significant corneal abrasion, [**Doctor First Name 2281**]
avulsion with intact lens, and retinal hemorrhages.  Plastics
fixed the facial fractures and applied arch bars and was trached
and Peggged [**2158-6-28**].  Patient steadily improved over stay, he
developed some impulsiveness that slowly subsided, he was able
to maintain POs, and achieve daily caloric intake by d/c, and
was cleared by PT and OT for d/c to home with follow up.

Radiology reports:

Head CT showed:
1) Pneumocephalus from multiple facial bone fractures.
2) Subarachnoid versus subdural blood along anterior falx just
above crista
galli.
3) Likely left frontal contusion.
4) Multiple comminuted facial bone fractures. Please see the
dedicated CT
scan of the facial bones for more information.

Facial CT showed:
1. Comminuted fractures involving the outer and inner tables of
the frontal
sinuses with pneumocephalus.
2. Comminuted fractures involving the orbits and maxillary
sinuses
bilaterally. Comminuted fracture of the left zygoma.
3. Right mandibular fracture.
4. Significant subcutaneous emphysema involving the soft tissues
of the
scalp, the orbits and neck. Pansinus opacification.

MRI of spine showed:
Subtle increase in signal intensity adjacent to the spinous
processes of C4
through C6 may represent injury to the interspinous ligament.

CTA head:
IMPRESSION: 1) Slight decrease in prominence of subarachnoid
hemorrhage
anterior to the frontal lobes bilaterally, without evidence of
new mass effect
or new intracranial hemorrhage. Stable pneumocephalus associated
with
multiple comminuted skull fractures.

2) Stable appearance of extensive facial fractures.

3) No evidence of aneurysm or occlusion of the vessels of the
Circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] and its tributaries, or of the cervical portions of the
carotid and
vertebral arteries. Visualization of the small branches of the
external
carotid systems is limited, and if there is clinical interest
for evaluation
of these vessels, standard diagnostic angiography is
recommended. This
recommendation was conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 5:00 p.m. on [**2158-6-25**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known lastname 50155**] was initially admitted to the BMT
unit but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with progressive hypoxia on
the floor on [**9-8**].  Her O2 sats dropped to 90% on a NRB.  This
was originally felt to be due to a combination of causes: 1) CHF
due to large amt of fluid received via blood products (had 2
units PRBCs, 3 units platelets in prior 3 days), and 2)?
aspiration during her bone marrow biopsy [**9-6**].  She had not been
responding to Lasix on the floor.  Upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
she improved markedly on BiPAP.  Because she was increasingly
uncomfortable with the BiPAP mask, she was changed back to a NRB
for awhile, and was eventually placed on nasal CPAP.  Overnight
on [**9-8**], she began having increasing hemoptysis, first having
blood-tinged sputum and then coughing up frank blood.  She also
developed worsening diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR.  She
was intubated on [**9-9**] so that she could undergo bronchoscopy.
While it was hoped that her intubation was only for the bronch,
she instead required mechanical ventilatory support until
[**2107-9-21**].  The bronch revealed increasingly bloody fluid with
successive lavage, so it was felt she may have DAH (vs a fungal
or bacterial pna).  She underwent a course of high-dose steroids
(methylprednisolone 500 mg IV bid x 6 doses) for presumed DAH.
On [**9-10**], she developed a pneumothorax on the R side that was
moderate sized (R IJ TLC was placed on evening of [**9-8**] with 2
subsequent CXRs not demonstrating a ptx, had bronch [**9-9**], then
had ptx on CXR [**9-10**], so unclear etiology.)  This was treated
with 100% O2 and resolved on its own, not requiring chest tube
placement.  She had another episode of bleeding and underwent
repeat bronchoscopy [**2107-9-14**].  This was also nondiagnostic.  She
was very difficult to wean from the ventilator, and eventually a
family meeting was had with her primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  It was decided to extubate her and see how she did, and
her family preferred not to have her reintubated if she didn't
do well.  However, she did very well.  She was able to be
transferred back up to the floor on [**9-23**], and was slowly weaned
off her oxygen.  By discharge, she was alternating between room
air and 2 liters O2 per nasal cannula.  She has persistent
patchy alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on CXR, esp in her
LLL.  The etiology of her respiratory failure was never fully
confirmed.  Her [**9-9**] bronch grew out a spore called
sporobolomyces salmonicolor, which both the ID fellow and the
Microbiology lab felt was a contaminant (as it didn't grow out
until [**9-23**]).  She may have had a pneumonia, as she improved on
caspofungin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin.  She also may have had
DAH.  She definitely had at least a superimposed component of
diastolic failure, and she was diuresed aggressively while on
the floor, approximately 1-2 liters per day.  She was originally
on standing Lasix, but by time of discharge she only received
Lasix (20 mg IV) after RBC transfusions.  In terms of the
etiology of her disease, there was also a question of vasculitis
(as she has a hx of polyarteritis nodosum which was reportedly
treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].)  However, her ESR was 18, and house officers
here obtained her records from [**Hospital1 2025**] which consisted only of one
CBC and no notes of any sort.

2. Cardiovascular:  On admission, she had an echo that showed an
EF >55%, with 1+ MR.  On the evening of [**9-8**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 50155**] went
into a-fib with RVR, rates up to 170s and bp 70s/40s.  She was
given Lopressor 5 mg IV x1, Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1, and placed on
a dilt gtt.  She initially did not respond to any of these
measures, and the dilt gtt was maxed out at 20 mg/hr.  A few
hours later, she spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm
with rates in the 80s, and the dilt gtt was discontinued.  Later
on in the ICU, she developed what was originally felt to be
atrial flutter and was evaluated by Cardiology.  They felt she
had a combination of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation
,and recommended control with a dilt gtt as needed, and po
verapamil.  She eventually no longer required the dilt, and was
maintained on verapamil with good results.  She remained in NSR
while on BMT as she was originally monitored on telemetry, which
was eventually discontinued.  EKGs were unremarkable other than
a-fib.

3. ID:  Given her fxnal neutropenia, she was begun on empiric
antibiotics when she originally developed diffuse opacities on
CXR.  She was treated with Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, bactrim, and
clinda (initially).  Her vanc was discontinued 2 days later and
she was begun on ambisome for empiric antifungal coverage.  Due
to the lipid content in ambisome and its possible interaction
with surfactant in the lung, she was changed to caspofungin.
Her induced sputum was immunofluroescent negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
rest of her bronch studies were negative for organisms other
than the spore mentioned above.  Her antibiotics were all
eventually stopped and she remained afebrile for a while.  She
also developed a sacral decubitus ulcer while in the ICU, which
was evaluated by the Wound Care nurses and dressed per their
recommendations.  Twice in the week before discharge, she had
low-grade temperatures but was asymptomatic.  She had a negative
urine culture and CXR showed a possible worsening of her LLL
infiltrate.  The team recommended that she begin po levaquin,
but she declined this.  She expressly stated that she did not
want to take any antibiotics, oral or intravenous.  She
understood the consequences and stated them clearly, but wished
to not pursue the infectious workup any further.  Therefore she
was not begun on any antibiotics.

4. Hematology:  Her bone marrow biopsy on [**9-6**] was negative for
blasts, as was a repeat biopsy [**9-24**].  While she was in the
hospital, she required increasing frequency of transfusions.
She received packed red blood cells and platelets every other
day, to keep a hematocrit greater than 25 and platelets greater
than 20K (given the fear that she had bled into her lungs, it
was felt that a platelet transfusion threshold of 20K was more
advantageous than 10K).  It was felt that her low hematocrit was
[**1-17**] to her MDS and was not the result of another process.  She
had a negative DAT x 2.  She did have evidence of hemolysis,
with a low haptoglobin, elevated LDH, elevated indirect
bilirubin, and a reticulocyte count of 6%.  Because of her large
transfusion requirements and possible hemolysis, a super-Coombs
and an anti-platelet antibody test were sent, and were pending
at time of discharge.  It was also felt likely that these
processes were all due to her myelodysplasia.  On examination of
her bone marrow biopsy, the attending heme pathologist felt that
it was likely her cells were so dysplastic they did not survive
long in the periphery.   Prior to d/c a conversation was had
with the patient where it was discussed and agreed upon by
everybody (including the attending Hematologist) that there was
no further treatment indicated for her MDS, and she would
continue with symptomatic transfusions.    On d/c her WBC count
was also low, with an ANC of 1100.  This is also felt to be [**1-17**]
MDS.

5. Liver:  There was a question of whether the patient had
hemochromatosis, whether iatrogenic or otherwise.  (Has son and
brother with this disease.)   The hemochromatosis genetic
mutations were sent and were pending at time of discharge.  Her
ferritin was greater than [**2102**].  It was decided not to chelate
her at this time.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French XBLAD 3.5 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual
contrast
injections.
Visualization of the left coronary artery was repeated after the
i.c.
administration of 50 mcg of nitroglycerine.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:
  We elected to treat the totally occluded proximal LAD with
PTCA/Stenting using heparin and integrilin prophylactically.  A
Choice
PTXS wire crossed into the LAD with significant difficulty (a
Wizdom SS
wire and several PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wires would not cross).
 A 2.5
x 15 mm Voyager was used to predilate in five inflations at 8-9
atm.  An
export catheter would not cross beyond the proximal LAD, but
suctioning
of this area resulted in minor improvement in flow. A 2.5 x 24
mm Taxus
DES was deployed proximally and into the mid-LAD at 12 atm, and
another
2.5 x 24 mm Taxus DES was deployed in overlapping fashion more
distally
at 12 atm.  The second SDS was used to post-dilate the overlap
area at
18 atm.  There was significant spasm and no-reflow in the
[**Last Name (LF) 12425**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
intracoronary nitroglycerin and nitroprusside were adminstered
through
the guide, and more intracoronary nitroprusside was administered
through
the lumen of a 2.0 x 30 mm Maverick positioned just distal to
the second
stent.
  Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual
stenosis
within the stented segments with loss of a major diagonal branch
(closed
at the start of the case), and TIMI-3 flow into a diffusely
diseased
distal LAD.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system
with two [**Company 12425**] CAD.  The left main had mild disease.  The LAD
had a 70%
lesion at it's origin and a 100% proximal occlusion.  The left
circumlfex artery had a 70% lesion in the OM1 branch.  The RCA
had mild
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures with a mean RA pressure of 24 mm Hg and
mean
PCWP of 31 mm Hg.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present.
The
cardiac index was markedly reduced, based on an assumed oxygen
consumption index.  Central aortic pressure was normal.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful PCI of the LAD with two overlapping Taxus DES (2.5
x 24 mm
and 2.5 x 24 mm).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two [**Company 12425**] coronary artery disease.
2. Markedly reduced cardiac index with elevated left and right
sided
filling pressures but normal central aortic pressure.
3. Acute anterior STEMI treated with primary PCI.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and no known CAD.  She presented to the
emergency
department with dyspnea.  ECG demonstrated anterior STEMI.
After a
discussion with the patient's nephew, the patient was brought to
the
catheterization laboratory where she was found to have occlusion
of the LAD with 80% stenosis at OM1.  She had a cypher stent
placed to the LAD.  She was found to have a low cardiac index
with low mvo2 during catheterization.  She was diuresed 1 liter
over the course of her hospitalization which she tolerated well,
and resulted in marked improvement in her oxygenation.
Hospitalization was complicated by increased bleeding at access
site after catheterization, for which hemostasis was eventually
obtained but integrellin was discontinued early.  Her hematocrit
remained stable.  As post MI echo showed akinesis, pt was
started on coumadin for a 6 month course after determining she
was not a fall risk with physical therapy and with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was also found to have a UTI for which she was treated with
Levaquin.

Chief Complaint:
chest discomfort and shortness of breath x 2 months

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy - pathology pending


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 37 year old female with PMH endometrial cancer
s/p TAH w/ R oopherectomy who presented to a [**Hospital 11074**] clinic with
two month history of shortness of breath and chest pain. She
describes the chest pain as ""like an elephant standing on her
chest"". She notes that it is associated with dyspnea,
diaphoresis, and lightheadedness. She was referred to a
cardiologist for a nuclear stress test about 6 weeks ago which
was normal per pt. Symptoms persisted over last three weeks with
increased fatigue and weakness. She also notes waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
feversv(Tm 100-101), productive cough and 18 pound weight loss
during this time. At the [**Hospital 11074**] clinic on [**7-8**], a chest x-ray
was done which was significant for mediastinal widening. She was
immediately taken by ambulance to Falumouth ED. At [**Hospital1 1562**], a
Chest CT showed diffuse mediastinal adenopathy and multiple
pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly. An echo showed small-
moderate pericardial effusion and increased tuerculation in RV
apex c/w RVA thrombus. NL EF/valves. Doppler US LE - Left
popliteal DVT. V/Q scan - indetermingate - 50% chance of PE.
Patient was stable during one day admission at [**Hospital1 1562**] and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further work up of the pulmonary
nodules and lymphadenopathy.  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was
seen by pulmonary and oncology. She was sent for a chest and
abdominal CT which suggested a 5x4 cm mediastinal mass with
precarinal lymph nodes, multiple smaller nodules throughout both
lungs and a small-moderate pericardial effusion. She was
hemodynamically stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and transferred to the floors
on [**7-10**] pm.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy. Small
axillary lymph nodes do not meet the criteria for pathologic
enlargement and
measure up to 6 mm in size. A large mediastinal mass, which
measures up to
5.4 x 4.7 cm in axial dimension, which extends from the right
paratracheal
region at the level of the thoracic inlet to the precarinal
lesion is present
with central regions of hypodensity suggesting necrotic change.
In addition,
there is an enlarged 4.5 x 2.5 cm subcarinal lymph node.
Bulkiness in the
right hilum is present as well. Evaluation of the central
airways demonstrate
patency to the segmental bronchi bilaterally. Examination of the
lung windows
demonstrate a dominant 13 x 11 mm nodule within the right upper
lobe, with a
satellite lesion in the subpleural right apex measuring 7 mm in
size. Most of
these lesions show some characteristics of spiculation. In
addition, there is
a 5 mm nodular region in the subpleural right lower lobe, which
has well-
defined forbers. The right lower lobe demonstrates mild
atelectasis, possibly
with a smaller degree of consolidation as well. There is a trace
right-sided
pleural effusion. The left lung is essentially clear, without
evidence of
pleural effusion. There are some peripheral blebs suggestive of
paraseptal
emphysema. Note is also made of a hypodense appearance of the
blood relative
to myocardium suggestive of anemia. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for the noncontrast
technique,
the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and small
bowel appear
unremarkable. The pancreas is grossly unremarkable as well.
Adrenal glands
are not clearly visualized due to the lack of IV contrast, and
no bulky
lymphadenopathy is the retroperitoneum or mesentery is noted.
There is no
abdominal free fluid present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The large bowel and bladder
are
unremarkable. Distal ureters are not well visualized without IV
contrast. The
uterus is not seen, and the ovaries appear unremarkable.

Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic
or blastic
lesions.

IMRESSION:
1. Large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph
nodes. These
have hypodense central regions suggestive or necrosis. These
would be most
ammenable for transbronchial biopsy.
2. Multiple lung nodules, two of which are spiculated at the
right lung apex.
3. There is a small pericardial effusion.

[**2161-7-11**]
MRI BRAIN.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cervical cancer
with pulmonary
nodule and mediastinal mass and patient allergic to IV contrast
for CT, for
further evaluation to exclude metastatic disease.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and
susceptibility axial
images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial,
sagittal and
coronal images were obtained following the administration of
gadolinium.

FINDINGS: In the right posterofrontal lobe, there are two small
areas of
signal abnormality seen within on the FLAIR images, one
laterally along the
anterior aspect of the central sulcus and the second superiorly
to the
posterior frontal lobe near the midline. Both of these foci
demonstrate
enhancement following the administration of gadolinium. No other
focal
abnormalities are identified. Specifically, no evidence of
periventricular
signal abnormalities are seen. No other areas of enhancement are
noted. The
ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. No evidence
for midline
shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.

IMPRESSION: Foci of signal abnormalities in the right frontal
lobe with
enhancement. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic
disease and
demyelinating process, given patient's age. However, given the
clinical
history and the location of the lesions, metastatic disease is
considered more
likely.


Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old female with h/o cervical cancer s/p TAH transferred
from outside hospital with progressive chest discomfort, SOB,
and weight loss with Left popliteal DVT, possible PE and chest
xray/ CT evidence of mediastinal mass and multiple bilateral
nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

1. Pulmonary nodules - On admission a chest xray suggested a
small focal opacity in right upper lobe and right paratracheal
opacity. A chest CT the following day suggested a large
mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes with
hypodense central regions suggestive of necrosis. It also showed
multiple nodules, two spiculated lung nodules at right lung
apex. These lesions were most consistent with lung cancer versus
lymphoma so a mediastinoscopy was planned. Other things
originally on the differential were: TB -PPD negative,
histoplasmosis -antigen still pending, coccidoiomycoses,
nocardia, sarcoidosis (scandinavian) - ACE-normal. On [**7-11**] she
had a MRI-brain, which showed two foci of signal abnormalities
in the right frontal lobe with enhancement. No edema or mass
effect was seen secondary to the brain lesions. On [**7-13**], she had
a mediastinoscopy. The frozen section was positive for non-small
cell lung cancer; paratracheal lymph nodes were sent for
pathology (still pending).

2. Non-small cell lung cancer - Multiple necrotic lymph nodes
radiographically and grossly, MRI of the brain with focal right
frontal brain mets; and a 1 by 1 inch paraspinal hard, rubbery
lesion on her Left upper back; presentation consistent with
metastatic NSCLC. Patient was told her diagnosis with her mother
and grandfather in the room. She seemed to take the news well,
appropriately becoming teary eyed. She was then seen by a social
worker and told the social worker that she was coping well and
did not need to be seen anymore. She was seen by oncology
consult and set up for
an outpatient follow up with multidisciplinary oncology team on
thursday [**7-16**]. During that time she will discuss chemo vs
biologic therapies vs palliation.
She will also have a bone scan to evaluate for bone mets also on
thursday as an o/p. On the last day of admission, the patient
noted blurriness in left periphery; no deficit on visual fields
or neuro exam; the patient was advised to have a head ct to
reevaluate for mass effect or bleeding in the brain lesions, but
she refused and wanted to go home with no further treatment. She
was counseled to go to the ED if she had worsening vision
deficits, headaches. The patient's shortness of breath was
stable during the admission; she required 2L oxygen especially
during long conversations; the patient will be sent home on home
oxygen.

2. Hypercoagulable state - DVT/PE/?RV thrombus - echo at outside
hospital also with possible thrombus in RV; pt obviously
hypercoagulable most likely secondary to primary lung
malignancy; she was maintained on heparin throughout the
admission and was switched to Lovenox and underwent Lovenox
administration teaching prior to discharge

3. Pericardial effusion - found on echo at [**Hospital1 **]; stable on
chest CT at [**Hospital1 18**].Most likely secondary to the primary lung
malignancy; patient did not experience any decreases in blood
pressure, increased shortness of breath, or increased chest pain
during the admission. SHe was monitored throughout the admission
for tamponade physiology and did not present with any.

4. Fevers - low grade throughout admission; most likely
secondary to the malignancy; fungal, blood cultures were
negative; lyme antibody was negative; patient never mounted an
increased white blood cell count.

5. Pain/Nausea - The patient had back and chest (pleural) pain
throughout the admission well controlled PRN dilaudid q 3-4
hours. She was started on a fentanyl patch for pain on [**2161-7-13**]
with dilaudid for breakthrough. SHe also noted increased nausea
with the dilaudid which was well controlled with phenergan.
After the mediastinoscopy, she had increased throat pain which
was relieved with viscous lidocaine.

6. 10 year hisory of perimenopausal symptoms - FSH, LH within
normal limits; no further work-up during the admission

7. PPX - She was maintained on a multivitamin and zantac during
the admission with colace and senna to releive constipation in
the setting of narcotics.)

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female
with a history of gastritis, hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on
[**2145-5-6**] for the complaint of progressive chest pain.
The patient described a two to three month history of
progressive shortness of breath and substernal chest pain.
The patient stated that the chest pain originally occurred at
rest and reported that her episodes had become more severe
over the ensuing time.  The patient's episodes were
characterized by pain radiating to both arms that would
occasionally wake her up at night and lasted approximately 30
minutes in duration.  The patient was reportedly evaluated by
her primary care physician and was presumptively diagnosed
with gastritis; an esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted on
[**2145-4-13**] demonstrated mild gastritis which resulted in
outpatient treatment with Maalox and Protonix prn.  The
patient continued to demonstrate worsening symptoms,
resulting eventually in a MIBI stress test on [**5-5**] which
demonstrated severe lateral wall reversible defects.  The
patient was subsequently advised to come immediately to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 256**],
where she was noted to have ST depressions in leads 2, AVF,
V5 and 6 and an old T wave inversion in leads 1 and AVL.  The
patient was subsequently started on heparin and nitroglycerin
drip which brought immediate relief of her chest pain
symptoms and she was subsequently admitted to the Medicine
Service on [**5-6**] for further evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension; hypercholesterolemia;
colon cancer; status post colectomy; breast cancer;
peripheral vascular disease; gastritis; status post right
total hip repair; status post thyronodular excision.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Sinemet; Levo Carbidopa; Lipitor;
Atenolol; Norvasc; Hydrochlorothiazide; Protonix; Benicar;
Timolol; Maalox; Tylenol; Multivitamin; calcium; fish oil.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Widowed and lives in [**Location 1439**] [**State 350**]
with daughter, formerly worked as a secretary and is now
retired.  No smoking and no alcohol history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service on [**2145-5-6**].  Initial inpatient therapy
included Aspirin, statins, heparin, and Nitroglycerin drip,
on which regimen the patient was noted to have significant
relief of her chest pain.  Cardiac catheterization performed
on [**2145-5-7**] demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate diastolic
ventricular dysfunction, and mild systolic ventricular
dysfunction.  A 30 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted
without complication through the course of the procedure.
The patient's ejection fraction was noted to be approximately
50%.  Following catheterization, the patient was admitted to
the Cardiac Care Unit for further evaluation and management.
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service and scheduled for urgent coronary artery
bypass graft on [**2145-5-10**].  On [**5-10**], the patient
underwent an off pump coronary artery bypass graft times one
with anastomosis of the left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending with a plan for postoperative
stenting.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without
complications.  The patient's pericardium was left open;
lines placed including an arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter,
and intra-aortic balloon pump; wires placed included
ventricular pacer wires; two slits including mediastinal,
right and left pleural tubes.  On transfer to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient
demonstrated a mean arterial pressure of 92, central venous
pressure of 0, PAD of 8 and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 18.  The patient
demonstrated a heartrate of 84 in normal sinus rhythm.  Drips
on transfer included Neo 0.7 and Propofol at 10.  In the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient progressed
well clinically and was successfully extubated on
postoperative day #1, [**5-11**].  The patient was returned to
the Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1, where
stents were placed both to the circumflex and ramus.  On
postoperative day #2, the patient was cleared for transfer to
the floor, at which point her IABP was removed and her cordis
was changed to a triple lumen catheter without complication.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic
Service on direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  Postoperatively
the patient progressed well clinically.  Physical therapy
evaluation recommended the patient for [**Hospital 5735**]
rehabilitation following discharge, after which point the
patient was successfully screened for placement.  On
postoperative day #4, the patient's chest tubes were removed
without complication; subsequent chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneuomothorax.  The patient was successfully
advanced to a regular p.o. diet and was noted to have
adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  On
postoperative day #5, [**2145-5-15**], the patient was cleared
for discharge to a rehabilitation facility with instructions
for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
an extended care facility with instructions for follow up.

STATUS ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 60889**] is a 79-year-old male
who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] preoperatively after
being referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for coronary artery bypass
grafting. He has a history of hypertension, angina, abdominal
aortic aneurysm, hypercholesterolemia and was recently
discharged from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1281**] Hospital prior to his admission
last week at [**Hospital3 **] for lithotripsy and bladder calculi.
He presented with an episode of nausea and vomiting, weakness
and chest discomfort. He had known renal and bladder calculi
as well as an incidental finding of a 4.4-cm abdominal aortic
aneurysm by report from his outside hospital. He developed
hematuria and was transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital to [**Hospital1 **] the week prior to this admission. Please
refer to the discharge summary dated [**2145-7-18**]. On the way
home from the hospital in [**Location (un) **], he had developed vertigo,
nausea and vomiting. He was then transferred in to our
institution for work-up for cardiac disease preoperatively to
his abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or possible stenting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Myocardial infarction [**2120**].
2. Hypertension.
3. Angina.
4. BPH.
5. Bladder calculi and renal calculi.
6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
7. Hypercholesterolemia.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes open cholecystectomy. He was
evaluated by cardiology and was allowed to return home to get
urology clearance from his primary care physician and the
urologist who had treated him the week prior in [**Hospital **] hospital
and to return for surgery on [**2145-7-22**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with
occasional PVCs, normal PR and Q-waves in leads II, AVR and
AVF and question of Q-wave inversion in lead III. Persantine
MIBI was performed which showed a moderate, partially-
reversible inferior wall perfusion defect and ejection
fraction of 55%. Echocardiogram performed prior to this
admission showed an ejection fraction of 55% or greater, 1+
MR and no pericardial effusion. Please refer to the echo
report. A CT of the abdomen done on [**7-13**] prior to this
admission also showed extensive atherosclerotic changes with
associated 5.4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with
no evidence of rupture. The left common iliac was also
aneurysmal and total occlusion of the right common iliac with
reconstitution of the right internal iliac and femoral
arteries. It also showed massive prostatic enlargement and a
right-sided posterior diaphragmatic hernia containing
mesenteric and omental fat. Repeat CT of the abdomen was done
the following day which also showed a simple, multiple renal
cyst bilaterally. Chest x-ray done on [**7-15**] showed no
evidence of free intraperitoneal air and small bilateral
pleural effusions with some mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. Cardiac catheterization performed also showed a
right dominant system with a left main 30% lesion, a
diffusely-diseased LAD with a 90% mid-vessel stenosis, a 99%
OM1 lesion and a totally-occluded proximal RCA. EF was 60% at
catheterization with no mitral regurgitation. Carotid
Dopplers also performed showed less than 40% stenosis on both
the right and left internal carotid arteries. The patient was
allowed to return to home for urology clearance and was
readmitted to the hospital on [**7-22**] for coronary artery
bypass grafting. He also had been treated for urinary tract
infection over the weekend. He was seen by urology who
recommended continuous bladder irrigation which we were
unable to perform in the OR so the decision was made to keep
the patient in-house for several days to wait until his gross
hematuria cleared. He was admitted on the 7th and followed by
our service.

On hospital day 2, he had some supraventricular tachycardia
with activity. His EKG showed no ischemic changes and he had
no chest pain. His hematuria continued to resolve.

Preop labs were as follows: White count 7.1, hematocrit 34.8,
platelet count 272,000, sodium 140, K 3.9, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 29, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, blood sugar of 117,
PT 13.8, PTT 27.8, ALT 52, AST 32, alkaline phosphatase 59,
amylase 35, total bilirubin 0.8, lipase 34. He was started on
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. twice a day and continued with
Lopressor beta blockade and continue also with aspirin and
Finasteride.

His pressure was 152/74 that morning. He was in sinus
tachycardia at 52 with respiratory rate of 20 and saturating
99% on room air. IV nitroglycerin was started briefly for
blood pressure control and the plan was to continue to
irrigate him over the weekend for his hematuria, and bring
him back to the OR on Monday.

On [**7-26**], he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a LIMA to the LAD, a vein graft to the
PDA and a vein graft to the OM. He was transferred to
cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on titrated Propofol
and phenylephrine drips. He was also seen by urology who
cleared him for CABG prior to the procedure. On postop day 1,
his index was 2.6. He remained stable in the cardiothoracic
ICU.

Postop labs were as follows. White count 12.7, hematocrit 32,
K 4.4, BUN 12, creatinine 1.0.

His sugars were covered by sliding scale insulin. He was seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist. He was on insulin drip at 3
units an hour and lidocaine drip at 2 mg per minute.

On postoperative day 2, he went into atrial fibrillation with
a ventricular response rate of 129. He maintained good blood
pressure of 114/52. His chest tubes were pulled. His atrial
fibrillation was treated. He received magnesium repletion
also. His creatinine remained stable at 1.2 and his exam was
unremarkable. When he was weaned from his drips, he was
transferred out to the floor and was seen and evaluated by
urology and by physical therapy to start working on
ambulation with the nurses and the therapists. On the 13th,
his urine was clear. He was managing his pain control with
p.o. medications. He was in sinus rhythm with some PVCs. He
was restarted on his cholesterol medicines. He was continued
with IV diuresis with Lasix. His blood pressure was 145/69 so
his blood pressure was titrated up. He did have some
complaints of nausea but this was not overwhelming. His
pacing wires were discontinued.

On postoperative day 4, he had another event of atrial
fibrillation overnight with a blood pressure of 132/68. His
Foley was discontinued per urology. His exam was
unremarkable. Incisions were clean, dry and intact. He was
alert and oriented with a nonfocal neurological exam. His
lungs were clear bilaterally. He was also seen by social
work. The following morning he was back in sinus rhythm again
with a good blood pressure. He continued his diuresis with
Lasix and continued to increase his ambulation and his
activity tolerance level.

On the 17th, he went back into atrial fibrillation and
heparin was started as a possible bridge to Coumadin. His
exam was unremarkable. He was saturating well on 2 liters
nasal cannula. His heparin was discontinued per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
His pressure came down to 101/54.

On the 19th, amiodarone was started for his atrial
fibrillation at 400 mg p.o. twice a day.  He was doing very
well, ambulating with minimal support. His creatinine was
stable at 1.2. His exam was unremarkable, clean, dry and
intact incisions. The central venous line had been removed.
He continued on Proscar 5 mg p.o. once a day for his enlarged
and somewhat raw prostate. His urine was clear. His beta
blockade had been increased to 75 mg p.o. three times a day
and he was discharged to home in stable condition with VNA
services, with the following discharge diagnoses.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Status post coronary artery bypass grafting x3.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 32 year old man,
admitted on [**2125-9-8**] when he was assaulted by his roommate,
early in the morning. There was positive loss of
consciousness.  When he regained consciousness, he crawled to
a phone and called 911.  On the scene, he had a GCS of 15 and
a large amount of blood as described by EMS.  He was taken to
an outside hospital.  There, he had a head CT which was
negative.  Besides the facial trauma he had sustained, he
began to complain of abdominal pain and was transferred at
that time to [**Hospital1 69**] trauma bay.
He was hemodynamically stable en route and complaining only
of left sided chest pain and abdominal pain.  There was no
previous medical history of surgical history.  He is not
taking any medications and denies having any allergies.  The
patient smokes and drinks.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial vital signs reveal a
temperature of 99.4; 81; 110 by palpable; 100% on room air;
GCS of 15; pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact, without pain.
Significant amount of facial edema as well as several
lacerations.  Mandible was intact. There were no missing
teeth. The mid face was stable.  The neck revealed a midline
trachea without any obvious crepitus or deformities.  The
left side of the chest was tender without crepitus.  There
was a regular rate with equal breath sounds bilaterally. The
abdomen was diffusely tender, had bowel sounds. There was
guarding but there was no rebound.  The rectum had normal
tone, guaiac positive.  Brown stool.  Prostate in the normal
spot. The back was without step-off and was nontender.  There
was no edema or gross deformity in any of the extremities,
which the patient was able to move without pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for a urinalysis with large
blood, greater than 50 red blood cells, lactate of 234,
normal amylase.

RADIOLOGIC DATA:  CXR and PXR without fracture, pneumothorax
or other acute disease.

CT of the head, repeated, revealed no bleed, mass or shift,
although there was a right maxillary sinus fracture.  CT of
the C spine was negative.  CT of the abdomen revealed a grade
I to II liver laceration and contusion, without free fluid in
the abdomen.  A cystogram was negative for extravasation,
although there was no contrast noted in the left ureter,
raising the question of a ureteral injury but again, there
was no free fluid noted in the abdomen. The spleen and
kidneys were otherwise unremarkable.  Facial cuts of the head
revealed a non displaced fracture of the left lateral orbital
wall and fracture of the nasal bones and septum.  There was
no right maxillary fracture noticed on the facial cut CT.
TLS films revealed transverse process fractures on the right
sided L2 and L3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the T-SICU for
serial hematocrits and abdominal examination.  His hematocrit
remained stable and his abdominal examination improved
progressively.  Ophthalmology and plastic surgery were both
consulted regarding the patient's facial fracture.  It is
likely that the patient will be able to enjoy non operative
management of his injuries, although he will be following up
with plastic surgery in a week as an outpatient.  An
orthopedic spine consult was also obtained and again, no
brace or operation was felt to be needed to manage this
patient's injuries. His urinalysis gradually cleared of the
red cells and as his abdominal examination remained so
benign, it was felt that a ureteral injury was extremely
unlikely and no further work-up was obtained for that
possible injury.  The patient is discharged home with the
aforementioned follow-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
Status post assault.
Liver contusion.
Left orbital wall fracture.
L2 and L3 transverse process fracture on the right.
Facial lacerations.

The patient will have his sutures out when he returns to the
Emergency Department within two days and he will be seen in
trauma clinic within two weeks as well. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] will be
following his spine.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Bacitracin to the various facial abrasions he sustained.
Erythromycin ointment to the eye four times a day for a week
prophylactically.
Docusate.
Percocet prn with 30 dispense.
Ibuprofen 600 mg three times a day with food.

was admitted for medical management.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  Aortic dissection:  Patient was started on a labetalol
and Nipride drip with a goal of systolic blood pressure of
less than 120.  He was continued on those drips with
titration for the first four days of his hospitalization.  At
that time other antihypertensives were added including an ACE
inhibitor, hydralazine and spironolactone.  At the time of
dictation the patient has been weaned off his Lebatolol and
Nipride drip.  He has also been weaned off most of his
antihypertensive medications and is currently on a regimen
that includes an ACE inhibitor, hydrochlorothiazide, beta
blocker and Clonidine.  His Clonidine is slowly being
titrated off as the ACE inhibitor is titrated up.  Eventually
he will only a regimen of an ACE inhibitor beta blocker and
hydrochlorothiazide.  His blood pressure currently is 120/80.

2.  MRSA pneumonia.  The patient developed acute hypoxia
during this hospitalization and has sputum cultures positive
for MRSA.  He was treated with a ten day course of Vancomycin
and a 14 day course of levofloxacin.  He was intubated for
six days during the course of his hospitalization for acute
mental status changes and in the setting of benzodiazepine
use and hypoxia thought to be secondary to his pneumonia.  At
the time of dictation the patient has an oxygen requirement
of three liters, is saturating in the high 90s and the goal
of care is to wean oxygen as tolerated in the rehabilitation
setting.

3.  Constipation:  The patient was continued on a bowel
regimen including Colace, Senna, Dulcolax, enemas and
lactulose.

4.  Acute mental status changes:  Probably secondary to
benzodiazepine use.  During the subsequent course of his
hospitalization patient was taken off benzodiazepines and for
the remainder he should avoid benzodiazepines as they clear
cause mental status changes.

5.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient after
intubation was maintained on a low sodium diet.  He was
diuresed after extubation.

6.  Prophylaxis:  Patient is on a proton pump inhibitor and
received subcutaneous heparin while he was immobile.
Currently the patient is ambulating for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

CONDITION STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol 325 to 650 p.o. q 4 to 6
p.r.n., albuterol nebs 1 q three hours p.r.n., Captopril 37.5

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 30119**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU on the Trauma
service.  After discussion with the patient and his nephew it
was felt having a craniotomy to evacuate his large left sided
subdural would be in his best interest.
On [**5-18**] he went to the OR and had left sided craniotomy, he was
extubated post operatively and had a subdural drain in place.
He was moving all extremities with good strength however less
strenght on the right sided he continued to be disorientated at
time.
On POD#1 He has a CT which showed evacuation of the chronic
portion with some reaccumulation of the acute blood but overall
improved.  He received 1 unit of blood for crit 27.   He was
transferred to the step down unit, he had some agitation after
transfer however, a second CT was stable, repeat crit was 31.
On POD#3 he was noted have some increase lethargy, a repeat CT
showed an interval increase of acute subdural blood he was
brought to the OR for a repeat subdural evacuation of
craniotomy. He spent overnight in the PACU, his exam he was
having difficulty speaking (which was similar post his first
surgery) slightly weaker on the right side though moving all
extremities.  He had an MRI Slow diffusion in the left posterior
frontal region indicative of an acute infarct.  He continued to
follow one step commands, slightly weaker on the right.

On [**5-26**] his drain was removed and a repeat head CT showed
continued evidence for a mixture of acute and chronic blood
products, as well as gas within the left frontal-temporal
subdural hemorrhage. Additionally, there is slight widening and
a somewhat biconvex contour to what may be an epidural
collection of gas subjacent to the craniotomy flap.
Neurologically he was awake alert, following commands but
continued with some aphasia though had no difficulty swallowing
or eating.   His right side appeared weaker than the left.

On [**5-27**] he appeared brighter following commands trying to speak
a few words.  He continues to move the right arm less than the
left.  He does have motor strength in that arm.  His appetite is
excellent.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
dominant system
revealed single vessel disease. The LMCA, LAD, and LCx all had
mild
diffuse disease but no angiographically significant stenoses.
The RCA
had a 95% thrombotic lesion in the mid-vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with a mean RA 14mmHg and PCWP 18mmHg. The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.86 l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PCI of the mid RCA using a 3.0x18mm Vision bare
metal
stent deployed at 14atm.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the mid RCA using a bare metal stent.

obtained. Coronal, sagittal, volume rendering, and MIP
reconstructions are provided.

There are no prior studies available for comparison.

HISTORY: 72-year-old man with ampullary mass.

ABDOMEN CT:

Dependent changes are seen in the bases of the lungs.

There are no enhancing focal lesions in the liver. There is no
biliary duct dilatation. In segment IVb, there is a 6-mm
hypoenhancing area, too small to be characterized. There is a
10-mm stone within the gallbladder lumen. The gallbladder wall
is not thickened. The pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen are
unremarkable. Few splenules are seen near the spleen measuring
up to 11 mm.

Both kidneys have few hypoenhancing cortical and exophytic
lesions, too small to be characterized, likely cysts.

In the ampullary region, there is an enhancing well-defined
round lesion measuring 10 x 10 mm. Otherwise, the small bowel
loops are unremarkable.

There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen. Few
non-pathologically enlarge lymph nodes are seen within the
mesentery.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for prior evidence of stroke. Eval cerebral vessels
EXAM: MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left internal carotid artery
occlusion and right ICA stenosis, for further evaluation to
exclude stroke and also to evaluate the cerebral blood vessels.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained. 2D
time-of-flight MRA of the neck vessels and 3D time-of-flight MRA
of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was obtained. Gadolinium- enhanced MRA
of the neck was acquired. The gadolinium-enhanced MRA is
somewhat limited possibly related to delay in timing and venous
contamination. Source images were evaluated to obtain maximum
information.

FINDINGS:

BRAIN MRI:

The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Mild-to- moderate brain atrophy seen. No evidence of territorial
infarcts noted. Minimal changes of small vessel disease are
noted in the white matter. No evidence of acute or chronic blood
products seen.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Mild-to-moderate brain
atrophy.

MRA OF THE NECK:

The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the right
vertebral artery. The right internal carotid demonstrates
high-grade approximately 70% stenosis at the bifurcation. The
evaluation of the right carotid stenosis on the post- gadolinium
MRA is limited secondary to venous contamination.

The left internal carotid is occluded at the bifurcation. No
flow is visualized in the distal cervical left internal carotid
artery. No flow is seen in the left petrous carotid artery.

The evaluation of the left vertebral artery on source images
demonstrate flow signal in a markedly narrowed left vertebral
artery in the proximal portion. Subtle flow signal is also seen
in the left V3 segment of the vertebral artery. This finding is
indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left
vertebral artery. The visualized great vessels of the thoracic
inlet demonstrate no evidence of high-grade stenosis.

IMPRESSION: 1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at
the bifurcation. 2. High-grade stenosis of the right internal
carotid bifurcation. Normal right vertebral artery. 3. Diffuse
atherosclerotic disease involving left vertebral artery with
partial visualization in the proximal and distal portions.

MRA OF THE HEAD:

The head MRA demonstrates absence of flow signal in the distal
left internal carotid artery. The supraclinoid internal carotid
artery is minimally visualized with flow visualized from the
left PCA to the left middle cerebral artery. On the right side
normal flow signal is seen in the supraclinoid internal carotid,
right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior
communicating artery is also visualized on the right side.

In the posterior circulation, diffuse narrowing of the basilar
artery is visualized with absence of flow signal in the distal
basilar artery indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease
with high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the distal basilar
artery. Both distal vertebral arteries demonstrate narrowed flow
signal caliber.

IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid with collateral flow
to the left MCA through the left posterior communicating artery.
Normal flow signal in the right supraclinoid internal carotid,
right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. Diffuse
atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery with probable
occlusion or high-grade stenosis in the distal basilar artery.

COMPARISON: CTA of the abdomen from [**2173-5-27**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis
was performed through the administration of Gastrografin oral
contrast and Optiray intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal
reformations were obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left with associated atelectasis at the lung
bases. The heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. The liver
parenchyma appears unremarkable. There is pneumobilia
identified, primarily in the left lobe. The patient is status
post cholecystectomy. The adrenal glands, spleen, and pancreas
appear unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically. Again seen are hypodensities which are
incompletely characterized on the current study in both kidneys.
The loops of small and large bowel appear normal in caliber. A
nasogastric tube terminates in the antrum of the stomach.
Contrast has reached the distal small bowel. There is no
evidence of extraluminal contrast. A surgical drain is seen in
the right upper quadrant. There is ascites fluid in the right
upper quadrant, tracking down the right pericolic gutter, there
is higher density posteriorly suggesting some blood. There are
also foci of free intraperitoneal air consistent with the recent
surgery. Skin staples are seen across the anterior abdomen, and
there is mild subcutaneous soft tissue stranding. No fluid
collections are identified within the abdomen. There is some
stranding in the right upper quadrant in the region of the
recent surgery. Vascular structures demonstrate atherosclerosis
of the abdominal aorta. The major arteries and veins are patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder,
and there is nondependent air in the bladder lumen. The
prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum appear unremarkable. There
is small amounts of free fluid in the pelvis. Note of a small
left-sided fat-containing inguinal hernia.

Osseous structures demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of anastomotic leak or drainable fluid
collection.
2. Postoperative appearance in the right upper quadrant with
foci of pneumoperitoneum, small amount of ascites, pneumobilia,
and nonspecific fat stranding.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left

ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERIHEPATIC FLUID COLLECTION DRAINAGE.

HISTORY: 72-year-old male s/p transduodenal ampullary resection
with elevated while blood count and fever and fluid collection
around the liver

PROCEDURE: The risks and benefits of the procedure were
explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.
Preprocedure timeout was called to confirm the identity of the
patient and the procedure to be performed. The patient was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1%
was used for local anesthesia.

Moderate sedation was provided, by a nurse, by administering
divided doses of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed,
throughout the total intraservice time of 20 minutes during
which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously
monitored.

Under direct ultrasound guidance with freehand technique, a
suitable spot in the right upper quadrant was chosen and after
administration of lidocaine, an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was
placed into the perihepatic fluid collection.

110 cc of greenish fluid were aspirated. A sample was sent for
microbiology.

The patient tolerated well the procedure.

There were no complications.

The attending radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present during the
entire procedure.

The patient tolerated well the procedure.

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided placement of drainage
catheter in the perihepatic fluid collection.

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 72-year-old man postoperative day 16, status post
transit duodenal ampullectomy for ampullary mass, also
cholecystectomy with fevers and leukocytosis on antibiotics.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained through the
abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2173-6-13**].

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases show right lower
lobe atelectasis with a moderate-sized right pleural effusion
and small left pleural effusion. The size of the pleural
effusions have not significantly changed since the prior scan.
The heart and pericardium are unremarkable. Within the abdomen,
there has been interval placement of a pigtail drainage catheter
within the lateral perihepatic collection, and there is less
fluid and air within this collection. There has been interval
development of a new fluid collection posterior to the right
lobe of the liver measuring 4.0 (anterior to posterior) by 6.7
(transverse) by 6.8 (superior to inferior) cm. The fluid within
this collection is of low density and there is no surrounding,
enhancing rim. There are no focal liver lesions. The previously
identified air within the biliary system has resolved. There is
no biliary ductal dilatation. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are
normal in appearance. Again seen are tiny hypodensities within
the bilateral kidneys, the largest of which is within the mid
pole of the left kidney, and measures 13 mm, and is most
consistent with a simple renal cyst. The remaining low-density
foci within the kidneys are too small to characterize. The
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. There is
an unchanged amount of intraabdominal ascites. Again seen is a
surgical drain coursing from the second portion of the duodenum
posterior to the liver and exiting the abdomen through the right
lower abdominal wall. This drain does not appear to communicate
with the newly identified liver subcapsular fluid collection.
The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel
are unremarkable in appearance. There is no bowel dilatation,
bowel wall thickening, or inflammatory fat stranding within the
mesenteric fat. There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric
or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free air.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon,
seminal vesicles, prostate, distal ureters, and bladder are
normal in appearance. There is no pathologically enlarged
inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is an unchanged
small-to-moderate amount of intrapelvic free fluid. There is a
small fat-containing left inguinal hernia, which is unchanged.
There is edema in the subcutaneous tissues consistent with
anasarca.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. New, approximately 4 x 6 cm subcapsular fluid collection
posterior to the right lobe of the liver. .

2. Interval placement of a percutaneous pigtail catheter within
the previously identified fluid- and air-containing collection
lateral to the right lobe of the liver. Interval decreased in
size of this collection from the prior scan of [**2173-6-13**].

3. Unchanged small amount of intraabdominal ascites.

4. Left lower lung lobe atelectasis, stable, with stable size of
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.

These findings were discussed with the clinical team and
infectious disease team caring for the patient at the time of
interpretation at 3:00 p.m. on [**2173-6-22**].

Reason: Please drain hepatic fluid collection. Do not leave
drain un

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man w/p Whipple, CCY on [**6-3**] for a bleeding ampulary
mass.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please drain hepatic fluid collection. Do not leave drain unless
puss. Please send fluid for Gram stain, culture, and amylase.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL DETAILS: Post-op. Loculated posterior perihepatic fluid
collection. Existing catheter in situ.

PROCEDURE:

Pre-procedure written consent and confirmation of patient
identity and nature of procedure performed. The patient was
placed in a lateral position to allow accfess to the loculated
6.7 cm x 4.1 cm fluid density collection along the right
posterior superior aspect of the liver. Following usual aseptic
technique, local and intravenous analgesia using a right
posterior intercostal approach, a 10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] multipurpose
pigtail catheter was inserted into this fluid collection.
Initial aspiration yielded 10-15 cc of serous fluid samples, of
which have been sent for microbiological culture, Gram stain,
and amylase. No immediate complications. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (attending
Radiologist) was present.

CT-GUIDED MANIPULATION OF EXISTING PIGTAIL CATHETER

The non-contrast CT scan confirms the existing pigtail catheter
in good position along the lateral aspect of the right lobe of
the liver. Minimal residual rim of fluid density measuring up to
1.6 cm in depth. The existing 8-French pigtail catheter was
flushed and aspirated. Minimal (less than 5 cc) amount of serous
fluid aspirated.

NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN:

Minimal right basal pleural effusion, consolidation in the
posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe. On the unenhanced
CT, no liver lesions or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. No
upper abdominal collections or lymphadenopathy.

CONCLUSION:

1. Successful placement of 10-French pigtail catheter into the
loculated right posterior perihepatic fluid collection,

2. The existing multipurpose pigtail catheter line was flushed
and aspirated and remains in good position along the lateral
aspect of the right lobe of liver. Minimal (less than 1.6 cm)
rim of fluid at that level.

Addendum added by: DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name 15706**]/jg????????????
Date: [**2173-6-16**]

Clinical: Pancreatic mass.

Gross:

The specimen is received in fresh in three, each labeled with
the patient's name, ""[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]"" and the medical record
number.



Part 1 is additionally labeled ""gallbladder"". The specimen
consists of a single intact distended gallbladder measuring 11.3
x 4.6 x 4.4 cm. The serosa is tan-pink and focally red and the
specimen is opened longitudinally to reveal approximately 30 cc
of dark brown honey-colored viscus fluid. There is a single
green gallstone measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm which is bisected
to reveal a green crystalline interior. The mucosa is tan-pink
and notable for multiple small yellow flecks. The wall thickness
measures up to 0.2 cm. The specimen is sectioned and represented
as follows: cystic duct margin and body in A1, fundus in B1.



Part 2 is additionally labeled ""right lateral margin"". The
specimen consists of a single piece of soft pink red tissue
measuring 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. One side of the specimen has
either been previously inked in black or darkened by cautery.
This side is inked over in black. There is a single suture
demarcating one side of the specimen which is inked in yellow
and the specimen is submitted entirely with the black ink side
face down, in cassette labeled C1.



Part 3 additionally labeled ""ampullary adenoma"" consists of a
2.3 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm polypoid fragment of tan pink mucosa
containing a 0.4 cm stalk. The stalk has been identified by the
surgeon with a blue stitch and contains the pancreatic and
biliary duct margins.  There is a 0.3 cm area of mucosal
ulceration at one end of the polyp. The resection margin is
inked black, shaved off and submitted for frozen section
diagnosis en face. A representative cross section of the polyp
is also submitted for frozen section diagnosis.  Frozen section
diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is ""ampullary adenoma with
focal high grade dysplasia. No invasion seen on sampled
sections. The adenoma focally extends to the side margin.  The
shaved common bile duct and pancreatic duct margin are free of
dysplasia.""  The stalk margin frozen section remnant is entirely
submitted in A and the polyp frozen section remnant is entirely
submitted in B. The remainder of the specimen is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in C-E, with the ulcerated area
in D.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2173-5-26**]. An ERCP with biopsy showed
adenocarcinoma. A CT confirmed the presence of an Ampullary
Mass.

#Carotid Disease
A noninvasive carotid study showed complete occlusion of the
left ICA and the right ICA with 70-79% narrowing.

#Vascular consult
An Angio obtained form an OSH ([**Doctor Last Name **], [**3-1**]) showed the
right ICA to be 35%  occluded. A neuro consult was requested to
work up his TIA's vs. Parkinsonism. A MRI Brain/ MRA carotids
revealed mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and occlusion of the
left internal carotid artery at the bifurcation, high-grade
stenosis of the right internal carotid bifurcation. Normal right
vertebral artery, normal flow signal in the right supraclinoid
internal carotid, right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that there was no intervention needed prior to
abdominal surgery.

#Neuro consult
Neuro found no evidence of symptomatic right brain lesion on
exam, but there may be a small stroke not detected clinically.

#Cardiology Consult
Cardiology recommended an Echo and Stress Mibi which were
negative for ST changes and showed normal myocardial perfusion,
and normal left ventricular cavity
size and function.

He was then cleared to go to the OR on [**2173-6-3**] and had an Open
Cholecystectomy and Transduodenal Ampullary Resection. He
tolerated the procedure well. He was NPO, had a NGT and IV
fluids. He was started on a PCA for pain control. He needed
further teaching on the use of his PCA before he was able to
have pain control.He had a JP drain in place and staples to his
abdominal incision.

#Pain Consult
A pain consult was obtained after the patient required Narcan
for sedation, a respiratory rate of 8, and pinpoint pupils. APS
recommended that he continue with subcutaneous Dilaudid until he
is able to take PO meds. He was then changed to PO Dilaudid on
POD 6.

#Seizure
POD 3, the patient had a 30 second episode of
non-responsiveness, blank downward gaze and increase fine
tremors of the bilateral upper extremities, right>left.
Afterwards, he was unable to remember the names of his
daughters, or remember the event. The family states that the
last seizure was 5 years ago. Neurology was consulted and
recommended Ativan IV for any further seizure activity and to
restart Tegretal 200mg TID once he is able to take POs. He was
restarted on Tegretal on POD 4, and has had no further seizure
activity.

POD 4, a UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB showed no evidence of leak at
the duodenal anastomosis. The NGT was D/C'd and he was started
on sips. His diet was advanced as bowel function returned. Stool
was sent for C.diff due to a frequent loose stool which was
negative.

POD 6, he was found down on the floor, obtund ed. He denies
hitting his head, he was reportedly confused and talking, but
thought it was [**2146**]. Neurology was called immediately. Labs were
sent and a Tegretol level was adequate at 7.6, WBC 28.4 and temp
of 101.9 axillary. He then became diaphoretic and was not
responding to questions and was not opening his eyes. It seems
likely that the patient was confused due to sepsis and
hypotension as opposed to a seizure related event. He was
transfered to the SICU. He was given IV fluids and started on
Vancomycin, Levo, Flagyl. A head CT showed no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

On [**2173-6-13**] he spiked a fever to 102F. An Abdominal CT on [**2173-6-13**]
showed no evidence of drainable fluid collection or abscess, but
increased bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on Zosyn
(Levo/Flagyl D/C'd) and continued the Vancomycin.
A JP amylase on [**2173-6-14**] was [**Numeric Identifier 67347**]. On POD 12 a UGI/Air with KUB
showed no evidence of a leak.

His JP revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and he was started on Fluconazole. His
WBC continued to be elevated 28.4, 33.5, 29.6, 23.5, 15.8, 20.6,
17.3, up to 33.7 on POD 13.
Infectious Disease was consulted and they suggested broad
spectrum antibiotics and that we should sample the pleural
effusion.

POD 13, A PICC line was placed and he was started on TPN.
POD 14, Urine cultures were negative. he continued to spike a
temperatures, up to 102.4 and he had increased work of
breathing. Interventional Pulmonology was contact to perform a
thoracentesis for the right sided pleural effusion and they
removed 1.2 liters of fluid. The pleural effusion was negative.
Occupational and physical therapy was consulted and he was
started on aggressive pulmonary toilet.
POD 15 a left subdiaphragmatic collection was drained by US
guidance seen on the [**6-13**] CT.  The drain was negative for
bacteria and positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
POD 19 on an interval CT scan there was a subcapsular fluid
collection.  Unclear the etiology.
POD 22 The Subscapular fluid collection was drained by CT
guidance.  The cultures have been negative for bacteria.
POD 24:  The subscapular pigtail was d/c'd
POD 25: The pigtail drain the fluid around the liver was d/c'd

Service:  Internal Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Upper gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year old
woman with a history of osteoarthritis and psoriasis who
presents with hematemesis.  She noticed this on [**2142-3-22**] but it resolved spontaneously.  She then experienced
melena and hematemesis of significant amount, one to two cups
of bright red blood on the morning of admission.  She also
felt lightheaded, although she did not experience chest pain,
shortness of breath or abdominal pain.  This has never
occurred to her before.  The patient has a history of
ibuprofen use, 300 mg three times a day for months, for her
osteoarthritis pain.

On admission, the patient was tachycardiac to the 110s but
blood pressure was stable in the 120s systolic.  Nasogastric
lavage was performed, showing coffee-grounds and clots, which
did not clear with 1.5 liters normal saline.
Gastroenterology was consulted and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, showing a 15 mm
crated ulcer with large blood clot overlying the base.  They
were unable to dislodge.  Epinephrine was injected with
success.  The patient received one unit of packed red blood
cells on presentation for a hematocrit of 24.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Osteoarthritis.  2.  Psoriasis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Ibuprofen 300 mg p.o.t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  She has never been
married and has no children.  She has a niece and nephew who
visit her often and help her out.  She drinks one brandy with
lemonade four to five times per week and denies smoking.  She
has not seen a doctor in three years and is not sure who her
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

CODE STATUS:  ""Do Not Resuscitate""/""Do Not Intubate"".

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a blood pressure of 119/56, pulse 100, respiratory rate
17 and oxygen saturation 100% on two liters.  General:
Awake, alert, in no acute distress, pale.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, anicteric
sclerae, oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple, no bruits.  Chest:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, II/VI soft systolic ejection
murmur at right upper sternal border.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologic examination:
Alert and oriented times three, cranial nerves II through XII
intact, musculoskeletal [**4-15**] in all four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 8.5
with 80% neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes,
hematocrit 24.5, platelet count 243,000, prothrombin time
12.8, partial thromboplastin time 23.9, INR 1.1, sodium 138,
potassium 3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 25, BUN 65,
creatinine 0.7, and glucose 225.  Urinalysis was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 88 year old woman with a
history of osteoarthritis, on ibuprofen, who presents with
hematemesis and melena, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing
gastric body ulcer.

1.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had hematemesis secondary
to a gastric ulcer, likely secondary to non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug overuse.  The patient received a total
of four units of packed red blood cell transfusions and her
hematocrit stabilized in the 30s.  She was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for one night and then
transferred to the floor in stable condition.

The patient had no more hematemesis or evidence of active
bleeding.  She was on a Protonix drip and kept on nothing by
mouth for the first 24 hours.  It was thought to perhaps to
repeat an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, however, because she
was stable, it was thought to best defer this to the
operating table setting.  Helicobacter pylori antibody was
checked and was negative.

The patient's hematocrit continued to remain stable.  Once
she was on the floor, her diet was advanced and she tolerated
this well, without any symptoms.  She will follow up with
gastroenterology in two to three weeks and have a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in eight weeks.  The patient was
told to strictly avoid any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, e.g., Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, and to use Tylenol for
pain instead.  She was also placed on iron supplementation
once a day.

2.  Osteoarthritis:  The patient was told to use Tylenol for
this.  She did not complain of any severe pain while in the
hospital.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol p.r.n. pain.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o.q.d.

Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is severely depressed (ejection fraction approximately 20
percent). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function
appears depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but
cannot be quantified.

Chest CT:
IMPRESSION: 1) Extensive calcified pleural plaques consistent
with prior history of asbestos exposure. Right pleural effusion
with equivocal smooth enhancement of the right posterior lateral
pleural surface but without nodularity or other findings to
suggest mesothelioma. Correlation with pleural aspirate should
be considered.

2) Cardiomegaly and extensive coronary artery calcifications.

3) Borderline enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries suggest
a possible pulmonary artery hypertension.

4) Atelectasis at the left lung base and bronchiectasiss.

5) Extensive calcifications throughout the pancreas consistent
with chronic pancreatitis.

6) Small nodule in the left adrenal gland which possibly
represents an adenoma. However, this cannot be fully
characterized due to the lack of non- contrast series.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1) CHF
2) Calcified pleural plaques with a large right effusion or
pleural thickening. Further evaluation with CT scan is
reccommended to exclude malignant mesothelioma.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 80 y/o male with h/o CAD, DM, HTN, asbestosis was admitted
in fairly stable condition after a modest diuresis at the OSH
and the ED.  He was managed for an NSTEMI and acute CHF
exacerbation.  We spoke with his PCP and pulmonologist while he
was here, and obtained records from his cardiologist.
1.CHF:  This exacerbation was likely due to a combination of
ischemia(NSTEMI), severe HTN, and chronic systolic/diastolic
dysfunction.  We started him on Natrecor due to his underlying
CRI and he diuresed well with daily goals of 1L negative fluid
balance.  Also got an echo which confirmed an EF of approx 20%,
and 2+MR.  His SOB rapidly improved, but he was still using
minimal O2 upon D/C.  He is on 2LNC at home chronically.  He was
able to walk without O2 in the hospital though without dropping
his O2 sats.  Patient was instructed to not eat salty foods and
wife confirmed they have seen nutritionist before and have
handouts at home of appropriate and inappropriate foods.  He was
transitioned to Lasix on D/C at 20 mg/day, with instructions to
weigh himself and take extra Lasix iof his weight increases by 2
lbs in 1 day.  Hopefully this will keep him from slowly entering
CHF again.  He was on Lasix in the past, then Bumex, but for
now, we will try Lasix with the above instructions.  His
cardiologist or PCP may elect to alter this regimen depending on
his stability as an outpatient.
2.CAD:Known h/o coronary issues.  His EKG showed a new
incomplete LBBB and his cardiac enzymes were positive for MI.
No ST elevations seen.  His anginal equivalent is also SOB,
which was his primary complaint.  Initially started on ASA,
heparin, statin.  His Coreg was held due to initially tenuous
BP.  He was briefly on dopamine, but was quickly weaned from
this.  His CKs peaked in 200s and began trending down.  There
was question of whether this was result of demand ischemia or
not.  It was decided that he did not need a cath due to quick
improvement and no further symptoms.  The heparin was stopped
and his Coreg was restarted when his BP could tolerate it.  He
was sent home on coreg, but his diovan was not restarted as his
BP was in normal range without it.  Will need this monitored.
3.EP:He has a pacemaker that was placed after syncopal episode.
There were no issues with abnormal rhythms as an inpt.  Repeat
EKGs showed QRS narrowing to more normal value.

4.Renal: Initial creatinine was elevated and was reported that
he had CRI since a hospital admission last year.  Records
obtained showed a Cr baseline close to 3 after that admission,
but latest labs in records showed Cr of 2.0 on [**2146-6-6**].  He was
in this range throughout admission, with last value being 2.0.
He had good urine output on Natrecor here and no other issues
with his kidneys.

5.Asbestosis: CXR done which showed pleural plaque and effusion.
 CT of chest again showed plaques and effusion.  His
pulmonologist reported that he has had this effusion 3 times in
the past and fluid analysis was negative for malig mesothelioma.
 It was not retapped here due to this information.  We scheduled
a f/u appointment for him with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Also instructed him to
continue using his oxygen at home as before.

6. Initially had elevated WBC ct.  Possibly due to solumedrol,
but believed to be elevated before this as well.  No evidence of

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old
gentleman presenting to [**Hospital1 69**]
emergency department on [**2166-8-12**] complaining of 24 hours of
dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, fever and respiratory
distress.  Patient was noted to have a significant past
medical history of upper GI bleed and was status post one
episode of coffee ground emesis the night prior to admission.
Patient was found to be in mild respiratory distress with
bilateral rhonchi, hypoxia and hypercapnia.  Patient became
significantly more hypoxic and hypercapnic and anesthesia was
called for potential difficult airway and patient was
successfully intubated.  Patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  In the emergency department patient was noted to
have a temperature of 101.9, blood pressure 118/50, heart
rate 119, O2 sat 77%, respiratory rate between 30 and 35.
Patient received sublingual nitroglycerin times one, noted
drop in blood pressure to systolic of 77 over diastolic of
54.  Given 5 liters IV fluids.  Subsequent ABG of 7.48, 38,
39 in room air.  Given 100% nonrebreather and increased O2
sat to 85%.  Patient was then electively intubated.  Chest
x-ray showed predominantly CHF with bilateral pneumonia
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  Subsequent ABG was
7.36, 45, 96.  Patient was put on assist control 14/400, PEEP
12, 100%.  Patient was noted to have bloody sputum with
suctioning.  No acute GI bleed.  Patient received CAT scan of
head which showed no bleed.  Patient was subsequently
admitted to the medical ICU.  Patient subsequently received
FFP times two units and one bag of platelets.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Head and neck squamous cell cancer in
[**2158**] status post XRT and radical neck dissection.  CVA in
[**10-10**].  Recent admission for GI bleed and hemoptysis.
Thrombocytopenia.  Ulcerative colitis.  Basal cell cancer of
the scalp.  Status post head injury in the [**2103**] status post
metal plate insertion.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone taper which ended [**2166-8-3**], Protonix
40 q.day, Fioricet p.r.n., hydrocortisone enema 100 q.h.s.
p.r.n., Colace 100 b.i.d., sulfasalazine 1000 mg t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Distant tobacco history.  Patient currently
nonsmoker.  Nondrinker.  Past history of ETOH abuse.  No
illicit drugs.  Patient recently widowed.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for prostate cancer in father
and uterine cancer in sister.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to medical ICU
temperature was 101.9, pulse 101, blood pressure 116/69,
respiratory rate 12, 96%.  Patient was intubated, sedated and
unresponsive.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
Mucous membranes moist.  Right IJ placed in E.D. in place.
Regular rate S1, S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs
showed diffuse crackles with occasional rhonchi.  ET tube in
place with some diffuse bloody secretions.  Abdomen distended
with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm, 1+
distal pulses, 1+ pitting edema [**1-12**] way up patient's calves.

LABORATORY DATA:  Subsequent EKG showed sinus tach at 110, 0
axis, right bundle branch block, slight [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in
4 and 5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to MICU with the
diagnoses of severe hypoxia, bilateral pneumonia, CHF versus
aspiration pneumonia, resolving hemoptysis, fever and
elevated white count at 21.0.  Patient was started on
levofloxacin and Flagyl, pan cultured.  Was given propofol
for sedation.  Patient's chest x-ray day subsequent to
admission was consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  Gram
positive cocci.  Was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.
Vancomycin was added for coverage.

Pulmonary.  Bilateral pneumonia persisted right worse than
left.  He was continued on Levaquin, Flagyl and vancomycin.
Medical ICU team had difficulty oxygenating patient further
contributing to patient's respiratory failure from aggressive
volume depletion in the emergency department and early ICU
course.  Patient was in excess of 18 liters positive.
Patient was placed on assist control, tidal volume 500, PEEP
16, pressure support 25, FIO2 50%.  Patient slowly making
gradual decrease in FIO2 to 40%.  Patient had decrease in
PEEP to 14.  Patient continued on course of antibiotics for
aspiration pneumonia.  Patient was noting to continually
desat with decrease in PEEP requiring increase in ventilatory
support.  Patient received moderate benefit from aggressive
chest P.T. and recruitment maneuvers.  At or around hospital
day 16 patient was switched from assist control to pressure
support of 10, PEEP 16, FIO2 40%.  Patient continued to have
thick yellow secretions, coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Chest x-ray slowly improving.  Right interstitial
consolidations.  Patient eventually tolerated decrease of
pressure support to 12, PEEP 12, continuing to wean.  Patient
was deemed slow to wean from vent settings and ENT was
consulted to do an O.R. trach for patient secondary to
patient's neck dissection and XRT for skin cancer.  On or
around [**9-4**] patient was at pressure support of 12,
PEEP 7 [**12-11**], FIO2 40%, remaining extremely sensitive to
changes in pressure support.  Drops from pressure support of
14 to 13 would make patient tachypneic pulling low tidal
volumes.  Patient remained slow to wean.  Patient was
decreased on his sedation of Ativan and fentanyl drips and
slowly began to wean from pressure support of 12 to eventual
goal of pressure support of 8 over a period of 12 days.  On
[**2166-9-10**] patient was decreased to pressure support of 8.5 and
40% and was started on trach collar trial for one hour.
Patient continued at pressure support of 8.5 and 40% for
multiple hours without previous tachypnea episodes.  Patient
was gotten out of bed to chair and had multiple successful
trach collar trials ranging from 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.
Patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix with a goal of
0.5 to 1 liter net negative on fluid balance per day.
Diuresis was somewhat limited secondary to recurrent bouts of
hypotension with systolic in the 90s, thus delaying diuresis.
Over the course of the hospital stay from [**8-12**] to
today, [**9-12**], patient is now net only 1.5 liters positive
in fluids and responding to Lasix.

Infectious disease.  Throughout his hospital course patient
continued to have low grade fevers in the range from 100 to
101.0.  Patient occasionally spiked fevers as high as 102.8.
Patient was put on ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  Patient's
white counts were in the high teens and subsequently
decreased.  All cultures, blood and urine, were negative.
Further all cath tips sent for culture were negative.
Patient was given abdominal CT and sinus CT to look for
source.  Sinus CT was positive for right maxillary sinusitis.
Abdominal CT was negative for infectious source.  Patient was
continued on antibiotics.  ENT was consulted for sinusitis
and suggested increase head of bed, intranasal spray, no
acute management necessary at this time.  On or around
[**9-2**] patient was found to be C.diff positive in the
stool.  Patient was started on Flagyl.  All blood cultures,
wound cultures and sputum cultures remained negative.
Patient without any new elevations in white count or
temperature spikes for the 10 days prior to discharge.

Patient's hematocrit ranged from the high 20s in the
beginning of his hospital stay and began to very slowly drift
down throughout the hospital course.  Patient had no source
of obvious bleeding, although he was noted to have OB
positive stool.  Patient was transfused two units of blood
with an inappropriate bump in patient's hematocrit.
Patient's hematocrit only increased from 23 to 25 status post
two units.  Patient's hematocrit tended to be stable with
slight decrease.  Patient eventually trended down from
hematocrit of 26 to a slow decrease over subsequent days to
hematocrit of 23.  Patient was transfused two additional
units of blood, bringing patient's hematocrit to an
appropriate bump. Patient's hematocrit was noted to be 31.
From [**2166-9-3**] patient's hematocrit has remained around 31 and
remained stable.  No active bleeding prior or since noted.

Neurologically despite negative head CT in the emergency
department, throughout patient's course with decreasing
sedation, patient continued to not move any extremities.  Did
appear to track and somewhat understand responses, although
he was nonvocal in response.  ICU staff remained concerned
while sedation was completely turned off for a period of four
days on or about [**9-1**].  Patient was given repeat head CT
which was negative for bleed.  Approximately four days after
shutting off sedation patient was noted to move all
extremities, although was noted to be weak.  Subsequent day
patient was found to be able to follow simple commands,
squeezing hands, blinking eyes, etc.

Trach done in O.R. was done on [**9-1**].  Patient was
also sent to interventional radiology on [**9-5**] to receive a
PEJ, percutaneous jejunal tube, for nutritional support.
Prior patient had been on a combination of TPN and tube
feeds.  At time of discharge on [**2166-9-12**] patient currently has
a left subclavian day seven and previously described PEJ tube
also day seven.  Both insertion sites are clean, dry and
intact and devoid of any signs of infection.  Throughout
patient's course he was kept on prophylaxis including
pneumoboots, subcu heparin and Prevacid.  Patient currently
taking Colace, erythromycin eyedrops, Reglan, Gas-X, Flagyl
day seven, lactulose, miconazole cream, Ativan, fentanyl
patch and Ambien.

Service:  MEDICINE [**Hospital1 **] FIRM

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old female
with a history of hypertension who was living at home by
herself and had been lethargic, fatigued and dehydrated the
past week because of a heat wave, fell down two days prior to
admission and had been down for approximately 36 hours when
she was then found by her son.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 42966**] where her sodium was 115, potassium 2.5 and a head
CT revealed an subacute subdural hematoma.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2112-7-10**] for further care.  Upon arrival, she had dried blood
on her scalp and appeared slightly confused at times, but was
occasionally oriented x3.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension x10 years
2.  Heart murmur, the character and type of which was not
known.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day
2.  Tiazac 180 mg once a day
3.  Levobunolol eyedrops GGTS

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a sister with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco history.  The patient
lives by herself, but in close proximity to both of her
children who check on her everyday.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION DURING ADMISSION:
GENERAL:  The patient was a well nourished, well dressed,
elderly woman in no acute distress, but slightly confused,
however.  Oriented x3.
HEAD AND NECK:  The left eye has a surgical pupil, but the
right is reactive.  Her cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.
NECK:  Supple.  She had no appreciable jugular venous
distention.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
CARDIAC:  She had an irregular heart rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur that radiated to the carotids.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nonfocal.
EXTREMITIES were 5/5 strength with 2 reflexes bilaterally.

LABS ON PRESENTATION:  She had a white blood cell count of
17.1, hematocrit of 30.4, platelet count of 265.  Sodium of
115, potassium 2.9, chloride 78, bicarbonate 23, BUN 24,
creatinine 1.0 and glucose 133.  The patient's cardiac panel
showed a troponin of less than 0.3, CPK of 666 and a CK/MB of
15.5.  A urinalysis was done which was yellow and cloudy with
protein greater than 300, large blood, trace ketones, small
bilirubin, pH of 5, specific gravity of greater than 1.030,
large leukocytes, negative nitrite and greater than 50 white
blood cells and red blood cells.  The patient's
electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with decreased
ST segments in V5 and V6.  The patient also had reports from
[**Hospital3 3765**] of a head CT of 1.2 cm x 6.5 cm of right
post frontal subdural without midline shift.  Chest x-ray
also by report from [**Hospital3 3765**] showed an obscured right
heart border and a cervical spine by report from [**Hospital3 42966**] showed no fracture or dislocation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit under medicine service with consultation
from neurologic surgery.  During her Medical Intensive Care
Unit course, the patient's repeat head CT showed subdural
hematoma which was unchanged to slightly smaller.  The
patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes,
despite the electrocardiogram changes persisting.  The
patient was felt to have hypovolemic hyponatremia and was
started on normal saline infusion with improvement of her
sodium from 115 to 120, as well as improvement of her mental
status.  The patient was never intubated.  She had an episode
of chest pain during her second Medical Intensive Care Unit
day, but the electrocardiogram was unchanged.  A second panel
of cardiac enzymes were sent which were again negative.

The patient was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit to the medicine floor on [**2112-7-11**].  The patient was
given intravenous Zantac as well as Protonix for likely
epigastric pain presenting as chest discomfort with no relief
of her chest pain.  The patient was then given 1 mg of
intravenous morphine which relieved her pain, but made her
very drowsy.  At this point, it was felt that the patient was
too drowsy in order to adequately monitor her neurologic
status and there was some question of whether or not there
was a depression in her neurologic status despite the
morphine.  She was then sent again for a repeat CT scan which
showed no change in her subdural hematoma and the patient
denied any further chest discomfort from then on.

The patient's neurologic status also remarkably improved by
[**2112-7-12**].  The patient was taken off of aspiration
precautions after a speech and swallow consultation.  The
patient was treated for her hyponatremia with fluid
restriction, thought likely to be SIADH given her subdural
hematoma.  Her sodium continued to increase through her
hospital course.  She was given some hypertonic sodium
chloride solution, 3% sodium chloride which also helped
increase her sodium level.  The patient was found to have
some congestive heart failure and was occasionally given
Lasix diuresis as needed.  The patient had an echocardiogram
which was completed on [**2112-7-11**] which shows severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild dilated left
atrium, hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction
of greater than 75%, aortic valve leaflets severely thickened
and deformed, moderate aortic stenosis, mild mitral stenosis,
1+ to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension.

The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation according
to telemetry and repeat electrocardiogram with slight
decrease in the level of ST depression from the baseline
electrocardiogram.  Cardiology was consulted in order to
determine how best to manage her atrial fibrillation, aortic
stenosis, but also given her contraindication to
anticoagulation given her intracranial bleed.  At that point,
cardiology's recommendations were to continue to rate control
her with Diltiazem 180 mg q day and not cardiovert her
secondary to the contraindications, as well as not give her
aspirin secondary to her bleed.

Neurosurgery continued to follow the patient until [**2112-7-13**].
Their recommendations were that the patient should follow up
in four week with a repeat head CT.  The patient was treated
for a urinary tract infection during the course of her stay
with Levaquin 250 mg every day with a total course of seven
days.  The repeat urine cultures showed no growth which
indicated that there was adequate coverage with the
antibiotic chosen.  The patient's electrolytes were monitored
on a daily basis and repleted as necessary, especially in
regards to her potassium phosphorus and magnesium.  The
patient was able to tolerate a full diet without any
difficulty and on [**2112-7-14**], her fluid restriction was
removed without any complications upon her sodium.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted
which recommended that the patient move on to an inpatient
rehabilitation facility in order to regain her strength.  The
patient was discharged on [**2112-7-16**] to an inpatient
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her right pupil was
reactive, the left surgical.  Extraocular muscles intact.
Oropharynx was clear.
NECK:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous
distention.
LUNGS:  Minimal bibasilar crackles at the base, otherwise are
clear to auscultation.  She continues to have an irregularly
irregular heart rate with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that
radiates to the carotids.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema and distal pulses are palpable 2+.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient has equal upper extremity and lower
extremity strength, as well as 2+ reflexes bilaterally.

DISCHARGE LABS:  Her white blood cell count is 11.8.
Hemoglobin is 12.6.  Hematocrit is 35.8.  Platelet count is
266.  Her sodium is 132, potassium 4.3, chloride 94,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 123.  Calcium
is 8.9, potassium 3.2, magnesium 1.9.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diltiazem Extended Release 180 mg q day
2.  Levobunolol hydrochlorothiazide 0.5% solution, 1 drop on
the left eye twice a day
3.  Levofloxacin 250 mg po x1 more day to complete a total of
a seven day course.

The patient is to contact her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 42967**], for a follow up appointment upon her discharge from
the rehabilitation facility with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42967**].  She will then
choose a cardiologist to follow up with on a regular basis,
as well as having a repeat head CT in four weeks and a follow
up appointment with neurosurgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
with history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and
diverticulosis by colonoscopy in [**7-10**], who presents with
large volume of BRBPR x2 this a.m.  The patient was unclear
about amount of bleeding, but quantifies it as cupfuls.  She
had 2 more episodes in the ED with 1 episode about 200 cc [**Name8 (MD) **]
RN.  In the ED, her hematocrit was noted to be 37.2 (baseline
36 to 37) and hemodynamically stable with blood pressure
129/88 and pulse 95.  Unfortunately, she failed NG lavage.
She has never had prior GI bleeding and denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, abdominal pain,
nausea/vomiting, palpitations, recent fevers and chills,
recent NSAID use, GERD, anticoagulation, ETOH.  She received
1.5 liters of normal saline following resuscitation in ED and
was transferred to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

NIDDM.

Diverticulosis with no history of GI bleed (colonoscopy,
[**7-10**], showing diverticula of sigmoid and descending colon
and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal to cecum).

Seborrheic keratosis.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission,
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. KCl 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
3. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Prazosin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Moexipril 15 mg p.o. q.d.
6. MDI.
7. Calcium carbonate.


ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN WITH UNCLEAR REACTION.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 96323**] with husband
(who is currently hospitalized in Rehab Center with CVA), no
tobacco or ETOH.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, blood
pressure 124/79, pulse 74, respirations 18, 97 percent on
room air with blood pressure and pulse changing to 99/58 with
pulse of 81 during course of examination.  General:  NAD,
resting on the stretcher, alert and oriented x3.  HEENT:
PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, clear oropharynx, anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs,
or gallop.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, 2 plus PT pulses.  Rectal:
Skin tag at anus with bright red blood noted, good sphincter
tone.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, significant for white count
of 4.3 with 16 neutrophils, 33 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 4
eosinophils.  Hematocrit 37.2, platelets 311.  Chemistry is
notable for BUN 26, creatinine 0.9.

On [**2140-5-16**], ECG, normal sinus rhythm at 79 beats per minute,
normal axis and intervals, left atrial enlargement, frequent
PACs, no ST-T wave changes from prior ECG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Bright red blood per rectum.  Patient was
typed and crossed for several units of packed red cells and
was ensured adequate peripheral IV access and given normal
saline for volume resuscitation.  Over the course of the
evening, she had several more episodes of hematochezia while
attempting to prep for colonoscopy for the following day.
Her hematocrit dropped to 24 over the next several hours and
the patient was sent for packed red blood cell scan given the
active bleeding.  This localized the area of bleeding to the
distal transverse colon just proximal to the splenic flexure.
She was then immediately sent to angiography, which
unfortunately was unable to localize the bleed.  She was
monitored in the MICU for the next several days and
transfused several units of packed red cells for continually
decreasing hematocrit.  She had a colonoscopy on [**2140-5-17**]
showing extensive diverticulosis in the entire colon, though
more concentrated in the left colon, and fresh blood in the
rectosigmoid colon to about 50 cm from the anal verge, but
most concentrated from about 40 to 50 cm and no bleeding
proximally.  While fresh blood was continually seen, no
specific bleeding diverticulum was identified.  She
stabilized over the next few days and continued on IV
Protonix, though the most likely source of bleeding was from
the sigmoid or descending colon, secondary to diverticulosis.
After her hematocrit stabilized with no further episodes of
hematochezia, the patient was transferred to the floor and
prepared for discharge.  Surgery had evaluated the patient
earlier, but did not wish to operate  at this time.  However,
we discussed with the patient that these episodes were likely
to recur and should they recur surgery may be indicated in
the future.

Anemia.  The patient was transfused a total of 8 units of
packed red blood cells during this admission.  She was
started on iron supplements on discharge.

NIDDM.  She was on sliding scale insulin, but will restart
her p.o. hypoglycemics on discharge.

Prophylaxis.  The patient will not need to continue PPI at
home as unlikely to have upper GI lesions.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Diverticulosis.

Lower gastrointestinal bleed.

Hypertension.

Diabetes, non-insulin dependent.

Internal hemorrhoids.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. KCl 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
3. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Prazosin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Moexipril 15 mg p.o. q.d.
6. MDI.
7. Calcium carbonate.
8. Iron 325 mg 1 tablet p.o. t.i.d.
9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.


FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was advised to follow up with
her primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3649**], in the next few days.
She was advised from the GI team to eat a high-fiber diet,
but that these episodes may recur.  She was instructed to
return to the Emergency Department immediately should she
experience any further bright red blood per rectum.

colon, but no blood seen anywhere, as well as a single
sessile 6 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance in the
descending colon, which was excised.  No intervention was
performed at that time and the patient did not have any
further bleeding.  Her hematocrit remained stable at 32 on
discharge.  Again, she was recommended to eat a very high-
fiber diet and take Colace.  A left hemicolectomy was
discussed with her in case of re-bleed and the patient is
aware that she may have to have this done in the future as it
is very likely that she will re-bleed.

Hypertension.  Her blood pressure medications were held, and
she was advised to not take them until she follows up with
her primary care doctor in the next week.

Type II diabetes.  Oral hypoglycemics were held while n.p.o.,
but she will resume her normal medications on discharge.

Diet.  Repleted electrolytes and the patient was tolerating
solids by discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Lower gastrointestinal bleed likely
secondary to diverticulosis.

Diabetes.

Hypertension.

Blood loss anemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As per admission medications with the
addition of Colace 100 mg by mouth 2 times a day.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was advised to call PCP for
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**] in the next week to monitor hematocrit and blood
pressure.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 826**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 year old female with PMH ESRD on HD, bipolar disorder was
admitted to the hospital on Section 12 for HD, since she missed
2 weeks of dialysis, likely due to underlying psych issues.
Concern for paranoia and inability to care for herself at home.
On admission, BP was in 230s. On arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt was confused
and unable to provide good history. During dialysis, BP acutely
fell to 100s systolic. After dialysis, pt was noted to be
unresponsive. Head CT showed new hypodense lesion in right
midbrain c/w infarction or edema. BP returned to 170-220s
systolic after HD.
.
Pt was evaluated by neurology/stroke team who noted neuro
abnormalities as follows. ""Patient groans to noxious stimuli and
flexes left arm. Vertical skew of eyes at rest with right eye
depressed. There is impaired adduction of both eyes on doll's
eye manuever. Pt was withdrawing left side to pain but right
side was hypotonic, with depressed reflexes and flexion response
only to noxious."" Initial thinking was acute cerebral infarct
vs. ischemia secondary to low flow state in setting of acute BP
drop.
CTA showed no evidence of thrombus in the vertebrobasilar
system. MRI showed diffuse subacute infarct of the brainstem.
.
ROS: Per nightfloat admission note from [**2161-4-6**]. No F/C/N/V. No
H/A. No visual changes. No abdominal pain/dysuria. No diarrhea
or change in bowel habits. No AH/VH. No racing thoughts. Could
not quantify how much she was sleeping. No feelings of
depression/guilt/ or feeling blue. No SI/HI.

Past Medical History:
1. ? bipolar disorder (Psych history is unclear)
2. Diabetes insipitus ([**3-5**] lithium use)
3. ESRD on HD - secondary to Lithium
4. HTN

Social History:
Pt is a homemaker. She used to work at [**Location (un) 40552**] as a
technician. No history of smoking or EtOH. No drugs. Graduated
college. She is widowed and has two children.

Family History:
No psychiatric disorders in the family.

Physical Exam:
VS: t98.4, p95, 170/87, rr10, 100% 2L

.
Urine and serum tox negative
.
EKG: Sinus at 100. LAD. Normal intervals. No ST changes.
.
Radiology:
CXR:Mild cardiomegaly but no CHF.
.
Head CT:
Hypodense appearance of the mid brain and brain stem concerning

for infarction or possibly edema. MRI with diffusion-weighted
images is recommended for further evaluation
.
CTA head/neck: no evidence of thrombus in the vertebrobasilar
system
.
MRI brain:
Diffuse involvement of the brainstem by T2 hyperintensity and
relatively abnormal diffusion. There is involvement of the
middle cerebellar peduncles, the thalami, left greater than
right and left internal capsule, all of which are consistent
with extensive subacute infarction with edema and expansion of
the brainstem itself. The presence of an underlying neoplastic
process would be less likely given the acute nature of the
events. Followup MRI with diffusion images, and correlation with
MRA of the posterior circulation would be helpful. The findings
could be related to an acute hypoxic event, which could have
happened during dialysis. Followup imaging of the brain would be
recommended as clinically indicated.

ECHO: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). 3. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. 4. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course, discussed by problem:
.
1) ESRD on HD: Patient was admitted to the nephrology service
and received hemodialysis three times weekly. Her initial two
hemodialysis sessions were complicated by acute hypotension and
unresponsiveness, as described below. Thereafter, she was
dialyzed with less aggressive ultrafiltration, which she
tolerated. However, she also began to cut dialysis sessions
short and occasionally even refuse dialysis altogether. Her
electrolytes were monitored closely. She had a persistently
elevated anion gap. She had one episode of hyperkalemia to 6.7.
EKG showed slightly peaked T waves.  As she had only a HD
catheter for access and refused PIV placement, IV calcium, as
well as insulin and D50 could not be given (she refused these
things as well).  She did take kayexelate, and she was taken for
an extra HD session that day.  Potassium level remained stable
thereafter.  She maintained on Nephrocaps daily, phosphate
binders, and eventually bicitra as well.
.
2) Altered mental status: Patient was admitted on a section 12
for having missed HD x 2 weeks. At her initial hemodialysis
session on HD #2, her SBP acutely dropped from 230s to 100s, and
she became unresponsive. A CTA of the head and neck was without
evidence of thrombus in the vertebrobasilar system. A subsequent
MRI was consistent with extensive infarction of the brainstem
and right midbrain. She was therefore thought to have a poor
prognosis and low likelihood of regaining normal consciousness.
However, within a few hours, the patient regained consciousness,
with intact cranial nerves, moving all 4 extremities and
interacting appropriately. The neurology stroke service was
consulted. A repeat MRI with contrast demonstrated persistent
lesions, which were thought to represent changes secondary to
electrolyte disturbances and hypotension induced by dialysis.
During her second dialysis session, she again became hypotensive
and became unresponsive. As described above, it was decided to
dialyze her more cautiously to avoid precipitating hypotension.
In addition, her blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate with
goal 170s-200s. The remainder of her hospital course was without
further episodes of altered mental status.
.
3) Hypertension: On admission, she was hypertensive to 230.
Despite having fluid removed at dialysis, her blood pressure
would continually increase to 200 systolic.  She was started on
amlodipine followed by lisinopril with some effect.  Her blood
pressure trended down as she tolerated longer dialysis sessions
with ultrafiltration.  BP was well controlled at the time of
discharge.
.
4) Anemia: Patient was noted to be anemic, with a Hct ~30,
presumed secondary to ESRD. She was noted to also have
hematochezia during hospitalization. However, it was small
volume blood coating stools, and thought unlikely to fully
explain her anemia. She had previously insisted on Colace warmed
in hot water and multiple fleets enemas. It was thought that the
small amount of blood was secondary to a superficial abrasion
secondary to excessive use of these agents. Iron studies in
[**2160-10-2**], and repeat studies during this hospitalization
demonstrated normal serum iron levels. It was noted that she had
never had a colonoscopy, and was therefore discharged with
instructions to follow up with a gastroenterologist for an
outpatient colonoscopy.
.
5) Bipolar disorder: Pt carries a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
under the care of a psychiatrist. She was followed by the
psychiatry consultation service during hospitalization who was
in contact with her outpatient psychiatrist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 40553**]) and
was started on Zyprexa, which she would take intermittently.
She also underwent extensive neuropsychiatric testing that
demonstrated a executive impairment consistent with a frontal
temporal dementia.  She was started on Aricept.  A team meeting
with her inpatient medical team, psychiatry consultation
service, and outpatient dialysis social worker revealed a
pattern of repeated noncompliance with dialysis despite
involvement by multiple social services. It was therefore
decided to pursue guardianship.
.
6) Leukocytosis: Patient was noted to have a leukocytosis with
WBC in the 20s, though likely to represent a stress reaction.
She was without localizing signs and symptoms of infection and
an infectious workup was entirely negative. She did received a
brief empiric course of levofloxacin for a presumed UTI.  The
leukocytosis subsequently resolved.
.
7) Coagulopathy: Patient was noted to have a transient
coagulopathy of unclear etiology. This resolved without
intervention, and patient remained without evidence of bleeding
diathesis.
.
8) Code Status:  FULL CODE.  Per patient's caretaker, the
patient has a living will but we were unable to obtain a copy.

History of Present Illness:
46 y/o Ethiopian male with a h/o T1DM, HIV, ESRD, and peripheral
neuropathy who presented to the ED with SOB, cough, and
pleuritic chest pain. Pt states that he was in his usual state
of health until he developed a fever (temp to 102 at home),
pleuritic chest pain, and SOB the night prior to admission. He
reports URI symptoms over the past 6 days. His last HD session
was the day prior to admission with removal of over 2L of fluid.
Pt was evaluated in the ED. Of note, he had not taken his
medications prior to admission.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, vitals were T 99.7 HR 70 BP 227/104 RR
16 and 98%RA. He was given Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1 and
hydralazine 10 mg IV x 1. He was also given cefepime 2 grams IV
and vancomycin 1 g IV. He was started on a Nipride gtt for BP
control and transferred to the MICU hemodynamically stable.
.
In ICU, he was monitored and continued on nipride gtt for BP
control. Renal was consulted and he had HD with 3.5 UF. He was
also found to have a multifocal pneumonia by CT scan and Abx
changed to vanco/levo. ID was consulted. When off nipride, he
was then transferred to medical floor.
.
On the floor, he currently has no complaints except that cough
may be worsening. He denies any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, pain. Pt in middle of changing dwell for PD and wished
to defer further discussion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB/PNA: Etiology most likely [**1-11**] to PNA and possible volume
overload due to missing HD; his SOB has improved after removing
2L from HD. On CT chest, he was noted to have diffuse bronchial
opacities concerning for infection. In ED, he was started on
vanc and cefepime. In MICU, continued vanc (dose based on level
and re-dose at HD) and started levofloxacin to cover for CAP and
possible HAP given recent admission in [**1-16**].  ID was consulted
and felt this was reasonable and low suspicion for other
infectious etiologies. Rapid resp panel was negative. He was
discharged on a course of PO levofloxacin (10 day course)
.
# HTN: Pt admitted with HTN urgency requiring nipride gtt likely
[**1-11**] to not taking BP meds for 2 doses prior to admission. Once
in MICU, he was weanned off nipride gtt and transitioned back to
home HTN meds. For the remainder of hosp course, he was
normotensive.

# HIV: Followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as outpatient. Recent viral
load and CD4 count 393 (and in this range in 1/[**2107**]).  He
continued his outpatient antiretroviral regimen. On discharge,
he will have close follow-up with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 9404**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:81y/o F with COPD- chronically vent dependant, HTN, p/w
altered mental status and difusse body twitching.

1. Altered mental status:
Was likely multifactorial given that she had a pneumonia, was
extremely anemic and was on multiple medications that could
cause confusion. We started treatment with broad spectrum
antibiotics and on day 2 of admission was narrowed down to
Levofloxacin 250mg. On day two of admission, patient was given
her morning medications which included neurontin, celexa and
clonidine. Within 40min she became lethargic and very difficult
to arouse. She had been on trach collar at the time and was
immediately placed back on mechanical ventilation given the
thinking that she may have become hypercarbic. Oxygenation was
100% the entire time. Team tried to gas patient but refused and
would not allow any blood draws. Nurse then brought the
medications to our attention and medications were discontinued.
Her mentation improved and maintained itself throughout the day.
She was also transfused one unit of packed red blood cells. The
infection, anemia and medications all contributed to her change
in mental status but the medication seemed to be the likely
culprit. Her Lfts were normal, her ecg did not have any evidence
of MI, enzymes were flat, ua was normal, not uremic, her gas was
not far from her baseline, glucose normal as well as ca/mg/phos,
no evidence of seizure. The celexa, neurontin and clonidine
should not be restarted.
.
2. Myoclonus: iron defficiency vs. hypercarbia vs. medications.
Patient was transfused with one unit of red cells, medications
were stopped as above and the infection is being treated.
Unclear as to which intervention stopped the myoclonus but it
has gone.
.
3. COPD/asthma: c/w fluticasone and combivent.
.
4. HTN: Norvasc and clonidine were stopped. HCTZ was restarted
on discharge. Patient normotensive, norvasc not restarted.
.
5. Anemia:
-has chronic anemia, on aranesp. Patient transfused two unit of
packed red blood cells. Hct stable.
.
6. Acute renal insufficiency:
-NS fluid hydration was given, Urine lytes showed FeUrea: >50%.
Cr was stable x3, ? whether she had medication induced ATN or
whether this is chronic renal insufficiency. UOP was normal.
.
7. Thrombocytopenia:
-platelets stable. Chronic thrombocytopenia. Follow up with pcp
for further work up.
.
8. Left lower ext edema: U/S was performed, no evidence of dvt.
.
9. FEN: sp/sw recommended soft diet with thin liquids,
medications in apple sauce

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
Upper Endoscopy
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old gentleman has been experiencing abdominal
discomfort, weight loss, and diarrhea since [**Month (only) **] around the
time when he was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for his MI and was
elected for medical management in view of CRI. Pt was seen in
[**Month (only) **] by GI for his complaint of diarrhea, decreased food
intake and weight loss. At that time he denied hematemesis,
melena, hematochezia. He reports having been evaluated by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41956**] at [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center, where a CT scan
of the abdomen revealed diverticular disease of the colon, there
was no evidence of inflammatory changes in the wall of the
colon, extensive vascular calcification was seen, the liver was
not enlarged, the patient is status post nephrectomy for kidney
stones and a small cyst was found in the remaining right kidney.
Upper endoscopy was done, mild gastritis was seen as well as a
hiatal hernia, because of the fact that he is on aspirin and
Plavix no biopsies were done at that time. The patient was being
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41956**] but became somewhat frustrated for the
lack of clinical improvement and came to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second
opinion. Pt had barium study around the same time which revealed
a transient lower esophageal spasm, no hiatal hernia was found,
a small bowel x-ray was not done at that time. He is known to
have an elevated creatinine which is 3.1 at baseline. He was
also known to have mild anemia with a hematocrit of 31.6 and a
hemoglobin of 10.9.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 41957**] presented to the emergency room with essentially
the same complaint of diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. He
could not provided a good description of the abdominal pain. He
does state however that it was diffuse without radiation to the
back and was not related to meal. He continues to have diarrhoea
and has lost 30 pounds in the past 3 months. Recently he has
noticed some melaena and BRBPR. In ER stool was brown in colour
but guiac positive. Pt also complains of sour brash without
actual heart burn. He states he was placed on PPI with mild
relief. He was also given empirical treatment of flagyl and
mesalamine with mild relief and has now stopped taking them. In
ER he was noted to have a hct of 27 but was hemodynamically
stable without postural bp drop. He was admitted for further
evaluation of his symptoms.

antiemetics and pain meds.  GI recommended a small bowel capsue
endoscopy and colonoscopy.  EGD showed Nodularity and atrophy of
the mucosa with contact bleeding noted throughout the duodenum.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology.  Colonoscopy
showed multiple diverticula with medium openings were seen in
the whole colon.  Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate
severity.  Ischemic bowel disease as well as a partial SBO
diagnoses were entertained given prior CT scans with mesenteric
calcificaion.
- Per GI recommendations the patient was placed on Protonix 80mg
[**Hospital1 **] and Sucralfate.
- The patient required 2 units of PRBC's during his MICU stay
with stable hematocrit thereafter. The source of the hematocrit
drop was thought secondary to Upper GI bleeding given the EGD
findings.
- An abdominal MRI/MRA was considered but not obtained per GI
given the lack of recurrent symptoms.
- Patient had Guaiac negative stool x2 prior to discharge.
- He did not experience any further abdominal discomfort for
three days prior to discharge.
- He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] at [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital **] clinic for
further evaluation should abdominal pain return.
.
# Respiratory failure/pulm edema:
Shortly after the EGD and colonoscopy, a code blue was called
when the patient was found unresponsive with shallow
respirations.  He was intubated for airway protection and
transferred to the MICU-East.  CXR showed evidence of pulmonary
edema and he was treated iwth lasix and nebs.  He was extubated
the following day, on [**2124-1-14**].
- Transferred to Cardiology-Medicine Service on [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name **] where he was stable for 72 hours without any oxygen
requirement. He did not require further diuresis.
.
# Cards vascular:
During the episode of pulmonary edema, the patient had an EKG
with ST depressions in V3-V6.  He has a known history of an
NSTEMI in [**10-17**] that was medically managed at [**Hospital3 **]
Medical Center related to his severe renal insufficiency.  His
cardiac enzymes were cycled and he had a troponin elevation to
0.46 without CK elevation.  His EKG changes resolved when his
heart rate normalized.  We treated his NSTEMI medically with
aspirin, plavix, lopressor, as well as a nitro gtt.  We
transitioned him to hydral and imdur which he tolerated well
post-extubation.
- The cardiology service was formally consulted upon transfer
back to the medical floor with recommendations for medical
management at this time. Consider stress imaging in a period of
6 weeks. This decision was discussed with Mr. [**Known lastname 41958**]
primary cardiologist at [**Hospital3 **] Med Ctr.
.
# Anemia: The patient had iron studies which showed a mixed
picture of both iron deficiency and anemia of chronic
inflammation.  Post-MI, we treated with 2u PRBCs to maintain his
HCT at or near 30. Hematocrit was uptrending at time of
discharge to 35.3
.
# ID:
Spiked temp to 101 overnight on [**2124-1-14**].   Blood and urine
cultures sent.   No evidence of infection prior to spike, WBC
has been trending downwards.  We did not treat with antibiotics.
He was afebrile for the remainder of the admission.
.
# Renal:
Patient is s/p nephrectomy with baseline Cr 2.8-3.1. His renal
function was stable at time of discharge.
.
# HTN:
He was weaned from his nitroglyerin gtt, we increased his
metoprolol (as he is paced) and continued with hydral and imdur.
Hydralazine was stopped on the Cardiology medicine floor.
- discharged with Toprol XL 300mg daily (pt is paced), with good
BP control.
- On outpatient follow-up the patient can be switched to
Carvedilol if he is feeling significant side affects from the
metoprolol. He tolerated the regimen well for a period of 3 days
on the inpatient service.
.
The patient was discharged to his home where he lives with his
daughter.

Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY/GENERAL SURGERY/BLUE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old
gentleman who initially presented with common bile duct
stricture with question of cholangiocarcinoma, who underwent
exploratory laparotomy and cholecystectomy with negative
biopsies now thought to have represented a Mirizzi syndrome
and resolution of his symptoms.  However, he developed a
recurrent strictureafter that required PTC and percutaneous
balloon dilatation.  He had an initial response but recurred
after the PTC catheter was removed.  A repeat PTC demonstrated
a stricture of the CHD at the bifurcation and distal RHD.Prior
to the operation, the patient denied any fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post stent.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Mirizzi syndrome.
5.  Common bile duct stricture.
6.  Chronic renal failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
2.  Status post exploratory laparotomy and cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day.
2.  Glyburide 2 mg once daily.
3.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Pioglitazone 4 mg once daily.
5.  Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2116-7-17**], where common bile duct resection, roux-en-y,
hepatojejunostomy was performed (please see operative note
for details). The patient was transfused four units of red
blood cells intraoperatively.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to Post Anesthesia Care
Unit in stable condition.

Postoperative day one, the patient had a low grade fever,
hypotensive in 90/40.  His epidural dose was decreased and
then eventually turned off.  He received fluid boluses which
would intermittently improve his blood pressure.  His
Propofol was turned off.  He also had two blood cultures to
rule out infection.  He was also started on Albumin infusion.

On postoperative day number two, the patient is afebrile,
still hypotensive.  He was started on Neo for pressors and
transfused two units of fresh frozen plasma to keep platelet
count above 100,000.  Antibiotics of Levofloxacin and Flagyl
were changed to Zosyn.

On postoperative day number three, the patient is afebrile.
His blood pressure improved and he was continued on Albumin.
He was weaned off pressors.  He was successfully extubated.
His epidural was restarted without hypotensive episodes.  His
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] is putting out large volumes (up to two free
liters of serous fluid).  His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] and bowel
cultures grew pansensitive enterococcus.

On postoperative day number four, the patient is afebrile and
vital signs are stable.  Good urine output, still high
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output.  His nasogastric tube was removed.  The
patient is doing well, starting to ambulate.

On postoperative day number five, the patient is afebrile,
vital signs are stabile.  He is ambulating with help.  His
epidural was capped, unable to remove it because of
coagulopathy (INR 1.7).  The patient was started on
subcutaneous Vitamin K for total of two doses.  He is started
on clears which he is tolerating well.  The patient's
creatinine which raised after his surgery to a level of 3.0
continues to be elevated.

On postoperative day number six, the patient is afebrile and
vital signs are stable.  He is ambulating and tolerating
clears.  Renal consultation was obtained who felt that the
patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency (baseline
creatinine 1.8) is probably due to a combination of
medications and dye.  The patient also underwent a T tube
study which showed that the right sided transhepatic tube
was open with free flow and the left side seemed to be either
kinked or plugged distally.  After the study, the left tube
was capped.  The patient's epidural was removed.

On postoperative day number seven, the patient is afebrile,
and vital signs are stable.  He is tolerating advance to
regular diet, tolerating well, left tube capped, tolerating
well.  Bilirubin decreased from 3.2 to 2.8.  He is having
bowel movements and ambulating with help.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] is
still putting large amount of clear serous exudate.  He was
started on ******************* which resulted in a
significant improvement in the patient's peripheral edema.
The patient was also switched from Zosyn to Ciprofloxacin
p.o.

On postoperative day number eight, the patient is afebrile
and vital signs are stable.  He is tolerating regular diet,
somewhat decreased amount of [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output, however,
it is still high.  The right sided T tube is open to gravity
and draining well.  Lisinopril was discontinued.  The wound
is clean, dry and intact. He is ambulating with help, and
normal bowel movements.  An ultrasound for further kidney
workup will be done later today.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged home with VNA.  The
patient should ambulate as much as possible, may take shower,
no baths, no swimming.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] to bulb suction.  T
tube to gravity.  Change dressings once daily.  Check wound
once daily.  Diet is diabetic diet.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Tylenol one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n. pain.
2.  Albuterol inhaler one to two puffs q6hours p.r.n.
3.  Ipratropium one to two puffs q6hours p.r.n.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n. pain.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. once daily.
9.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
10. Protonix 40 mg p.o. twice a day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Common bile duct stricture, status post roux-en-y
hepatojejunostomy.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4.  Chronic renal failure.
5.  Acute renal failure.
6.  Postoperative coagulopathy.
7.  Postoperative anemia.

presented to OSH p 4 days of progressive SOB and subjective
fevers at home.  2 days PTA, pt seen by PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o cough prod
of yellow sputum and was started on Levoquin for question of
PNA.  Pt presented to OSH [**2160-2-13**] after hallucinating at home
and increasing SOB.  Pt awoke the night of admission at home and
insisted to husband that there was someone in the house when
there was not.  At OSH CXR showed bilateral infiltrates and was
found to be hypoxic with O2 sat of 76% on RA.  At that time, she
was thought to have worsening PNA +/- CHF.  Her BNP was elevated
in the 800's.  She was started on BiPAP and transferred to the
ICU. She was given Ceftaz and Clinda as well as steroids for
presumed COPD flare.  She was diuresed with lasix. Her
oxygenation did not improve and she was combative with BiPAP, so
was intubated [**2160-2-15**].  She had a CTA that was negative for PE,
but showed patchy ground glass infiltrates with septal
thickening consistent with ""crazy paving"". Radiology ddx
included ARDS, PCP PNA, alveolar proteinosis, among others.
Vancomycin and Bactrim were added.  During the course at the
OSH, the pt had elevated CKs to 2400 with negative MB fraction
and negative troponin I. Her EKG shows small 1mm ST depressions
in the lateral leads from [**2-14**].  She had a negative UA, negative
influenza DFA, sputum cx that grew [**Female First Name (un) **], no PCP X 2.  Tox
screen was + for opiates on admission.  Pt was started on Zydis

CXR [**2160-4-3**]- There is no pneumothorax. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left. Again seen are the
diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities bilaterally, which have
slightly improved since prior exam. The findings are consistent
with the pulmonary consolidation of ARDS.
*
CT CHEST [**2160-3-12**]-IMPRESSION:
1) Limited study due to artifacts from the arms.
2) Worsening of bilateral patchy consolidation, especially in
the right upper and middle lobe, probably representing worsening
multifocal pneumonia in this patient with ARDS, however, the
consolidation can represent atypical edema.
3) Improvement of diffuse ground glass opacities representing
improving edema.
4) Slightly increased bilateral pleural effusion associated with
edematous atelectasis.
5) Slightly increased ascites with gallbladder edema.
6) Extensive edematous change of subcutaneous tissue of the
thorax and upper abdomen.
7) Persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy
*
ABDOMINAL U/S [**2160-3-14**]- Limited portable scan was performed.
Small amount of ascites is identified, however, no dominant
pocket which could safely be accessed for fluid. There is
evidence of cholelithiasis. However, the gallbladder itself
shows no signs to suggest cholecystitis. The liver is
homogeneous in echo texture. There are no focal mass lesions or
dilated intrahepatic biliary radicles. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are appreciated
*
CTA [**2160-3-17**]- Negative for PE. bilateral consolidations c/w
multifocal pneumonia in this patient w/ ARDS
*
CT CHEST [**2160-2-17**]- IMPRESSION:
1) Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity with septal
thickening. Confluent areas of dependent consolidation primarily
within the lower lobes. These findings could relate to pulmonary
edema, diffuse atypical lung infection such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] ARDS.
Possible contributing aspiration. The acuity of the respiratory
distress renders pulmonary alveolar proteinosis less likely,
although the ground-glass opacity and thickened septae could be
radiographically consistent with this diagnosis. Correlation
with bronchoscopic findings of same date are recommended.

2) Centrilobular nodular opacity in the right middle lobe,
suggests possible superimposed infectious process.

3) Ascites, hepatic enlargement, and possible varices,
incompletely imaged on this examination. Clinical correlation is
recommended. Could further evaluate with CT or US.

4) Prominence of the right and left adrenal glands, incompletely
imaged on the present examination. No definite focal masses are
visualized. Clinical correlation is recommended. Could further
evaluate with CT.

*
CXR [**2160-2-16**]- Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltration is noted.
Appearance of the infiltration in the left upper lobe is more
pronounced at this time. Dense infiltration throughout the right
lung is unchanged.
*
CT Head [**2160-2-16**]- There is no intra or extraaxial hemorrhage,
midline shift, or mass effect. The ventricles are normal

Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o F with h/o Hep C and COPD with acute onset SOB, fevers,
prod. cough quickly decompensating requiring intubation for
ventilatory support.  OSH CT shows ""crazy paving"" c/w a broad
differential including PCP PNA, ARDS, CHF etc. Patient
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management in stable condition,
intubated on sedation and dopamine gtts.  Hospital course
outlined by problem below:

1. Respiratory failure: It was felt that she had ARDS from an
unknown viral etiology.  She had no evidence of bacterial sepsis
with sterile blood cultures.  She had no evidence for influenza
and the common respiratory viral pattern was negative. She was
supported on low volume ventilation with permissive hypercapnia
according to ARDSnet treatment protocol, then treated for
fibroproliferative ARDS with steroids when she failed to improve
significantly after 7 days (Maduri protocol).  She was started
on broad antibiotic coverage including Vanco, Ceftaz, and
Clinda.  ATrovent and albuterol nebs were initiated.  She
underwent bronchoscopy with BAL which demonstrated no culprit
microorganims.  She reportably had an elevated BNP at the OSH
suggesting a cardiogenic component of her pulmonary dysfunction.
 She was diuresed.  Her ICU course was complicated by the
development of ventilator associated pneumonia due to Klebsiella
oxytoca and Serratioa marscencs sensitive to meropenem and
resistent to cephalosporins.  She was treated with a long course
of levofloxacin and meropenem and continued to spike low grade
fevers despite no further culture of additional organisms.
These fevers were felt to be related to continued episodes of
aspiration pneumonitis given the large amount of oral secretions
she had, chest films demonstrating infiltrates, and
defervescence and normalization of leukocytosis despite no
broadening of antibiotic coverage.  She was difficult to wean
from the vent given her tendency for agitation and poor
oxygenation in the setting of increased work of breathing. In
addition, chest wall edema had significantly decreased her chest
wall compliance, increasing her need for higher levels of PEEP.
With a very slow taper in her sedatives, treatment of her
ventilator-associated pneumonia, and aggressive diuresis to
decrease chest wall edema, she made slow improvement in her
respiratory function.  She underwent tracheostomy placement and
was weaned off the vent. Fitted for Passy-Muir Valve.
She was subsequently able to maintain O2 sats >93% with 40% FiO2
trach collar.

2. Hypotension: Although BNP was elevated, her ECHO demonstrated
no significant LV systolic failure.  It was thought that she was
overdiuresed at the outside hospital following her diagnosis of
heart failure by BNP and bilateral pulmonary infitrates.  Her
dopamine was weaned off as her volume status was corrected
(initially after diuresing her, then adding volume back after it
was determined that she was hypovolemic).  She required pressors
from time to time to maintain adequate MAPs in the setting of
aggressive diuresis with urine outputs ranging from 200-500 per
hour. Her BP also runs low, likely from cirrhotic physiology as
she has HCV and evidence for liver failure (telangectasia, mild
ascites).

3. Substance abuse - On presentation to the OSH her tox screen
was positive for opaiates.  There is no history of IVDU or
opiate pain med use.  She required large doses of versed and
fentanyl for sedation which supports a chronic use of opiate as
an outpatient.  Patient slowly weaned off versed and fentanyl.
Started haldol inpatient to decrease agitation and help wean off
vent.  Once off vent kept patient on lower dose haldol 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
and then on an as needed basis. Placed on ativan taper given her
prolonged course on vent. Will continue to wean off ativan and
use CIWA scale for withdrawl control.

4. Line infections: Her ICU course was complicated by the
development of coagulase neative line infections.  She was
treated with a 14 day course of vancomycin beginning after the
infected lines were pulled. Survielence blood cultures were
subsequently negative.

5. Seizures - She was continued on her phenytoin as scheduled.
EEG was negative while here but she was on large amounts of
versed significantly lowering the usefullness of the EEG. No
evidence of seizure activity following removal from sedatives.
Following dilantin level, with last corrected level=13 on
[**2160-4-6**].

6. Volume Overload - Patient with diffuse anasarca.
Aggressively diuresed with lasix. Also started patient on
aldactone secondary to patient being hypokalemic from aggresive
diuresis. She diuresed well and is near euvolemia upon
discharge. She is off standing lasix/aldactone. Lasix may be
used as needed to maintain euvolemia. She has responded well to
40mg IV.

7. Chronic HCV: mild transmainitis and gall bladder edema, as
seen on CT [**3-12**]. Ultrasound on [**3-14**] shows cholelithiasis with no
evidence of cholecystitis. Small amount of ascites seen, but no
dominant pocket of fluid ammenable to tap. Liver was homogenous
in appearance without mass/nodules.

8. anemia: labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Hct
stable. Consider PRBC for HCt < 26.

9. FEN: PEG placed([**3-11**]), TF to goal. Continued to monitor lytes
and repleted prn. Tolerating mechanical softs. Repete bedside
swallow study when appropriate.

10. PPX - PPI, heparin, bowel regimien (hold for diarrhea)
11. Access - Currently PICC placed in R arm.

Date of Birth:   [**2056-8-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old male with
poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia with
refractive atrial fibrillation who has been cardioverted
every few months since [**2103-4-2**], but only remains in
normal sinus rhythm a few weeks after cardioversion.  An RF
ablation was attempted in [**2106-5-3**], but was aborted due
to vagal episodes and systolic blood pressures in the 50s.
He was admitted [**2106-8-2**] for an elective RF ablation.
During the procedure, contrast was noted in the pericardium
which was thought due to a possible septal perforation.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was done which showed a
moderate sized effusion and patient began hypotensive.
Tamponade was suspected and pericardial drain was placed from
which approximately 300 cc was removed with another 60 cc
being removed over the following hour.  A repeat
echocardiogram was then performed which showed that the drain
was still in place and there was no residual effusion.  While
in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient complained of
chest pain refractory to most medications and 1% lidocaine
was administered through the drain with excellent relief of
symptoms.

He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for close
hemodynamic monitoring, as well as telemetry.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Peptic ulcer disease.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Gout.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Status post spinal cord injury from a motor vehicle
accident in [**2094**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Neck surgery secondary to motor vehicle accident.
2.  Laryngeal polyps removed as a teenager.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies any tobacco use.  Occasional
alcohol use.  He is married.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hyzaar 100/25 mg.
2.  Norvasc 5 mg.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg.
4.  Probenecid 500 mg b.i.d.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Zestoretic causing gastrointestinal upset.
Penicillin, allopurinol causing facial swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
Temperature 99.9.  Blood pressure 131/74.  Heart rate 86 in
normal sinus rhythm. Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen saturation
95% on three liters nasal cannula.  Patient is in no apparent
distress, winces mildly in pain. Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  There was no carotid bruits present.
His lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly (patient was
lying flat due to pericardial drain).  His heart was regular
rate with a normal S1, S2.  The drain was in place with no
oozing or hematoma.  On abdominal exam, the patient was
nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds were
present.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly.  There was no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The femoral sheath was in place
on the left side.  There was no hematoma or signs of
infection.  2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
were felt bilaterally.  Skin was warm and dry.  He was alert
and oriented, mildly sedated, but answered questions
appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 18.1,
hemoglobin 15.3, hematocrit 42.9, platelet count 233,000.  PT
13.1, PTT 28.0.  Sodium 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 19, creatinine 1.1, glucose of 136.

ADMISSION ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm with
a heart rate of 95, normal axis and intervals, no acute ST or
T wave changes when compared to previous electrocardiograms.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 49-year-old man with refractory atrial
fibrillation, here for a second RF ablation, complicated by
perforation and tamponade, treated with pericardial drain and
resolution of effusion by transesophageal echocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1. Cardiac:  The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit with a pericardial drain in place, very sedated.  He
developed atrial fibrillation around 11 a.m. the following
day and was cardioverted times two with 2 mg intravenous
ibutilide administered with reversion back to normal sinus
rhythm.  Pericardial drain was pulled a few hours later.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed no
pericardial effusion and no pulmonary vein stenosis.  A small
ASD which was previously known was also noted.  Following
conversion to normal sinus rhythm, the patient was started on
propafenone 225 b.i.d.  He was also restarted on his losartan
100 and Atenolol 50 q.d. which he takes as an outpatient.  No
other events were noted on telemetry and patient remained in
normal sinus rhythm for remainder of hospital course.

2.  Pulmonary:  Patient with no signs of heart failure.
Oxygen saturations were in the high 90s on two liters nasal
cannula.

3.  Hematology:  Of note, hematocrit dropped from 43 to 35
which was assumed mostly dilutional due to large volume of
intravenous fluids administered. He was stable around 35 on
discharge.

4.  Rheumatology:  The patient was treated with probenecid
for gout prophylaxis.  He had no symptoms of acute gout
during the hospital course.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable and improved.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation, status post RF ablation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Gout.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Asthma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 q.d.
2.  Colace 200 b.i.d.
3.  Prednisone taper for pericardial irritation.
4.  Atenolol 50 q.d.
5.  Propafenone 225 b.i.d.
6.  Losartan 100 q.d.
7.  Percocet 1-2 tablets q. 4-6 hours prn pain #30 pills.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg.

FOLLOW-UP:
1.  Patient to schedule an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
one month.
2. Two week course of [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's.  Patient was scheduled
to have [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's set up before discharge, however,
patient refused to wait for the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's to be placed
and, therefore, arrangements were made for patient to go to

Service:  CSU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
male without a history of coronary artery disease who reports
dyspnea on exertion and shoulder discomfort with exertion,
and these symptoms resolve with rest. He had a stress
echocardiogram on [**2154-3-13**] which revealed EKG changes
and hypokinesis and akinesis in the inferior wall. His cath
on [**3-14**] showed severe 3-vessel disease. His LAD was 90%
occluded, D1 was 80%, left circumflex was 90%, and RCA was
90% occluded. He was therefore referred for coronary artery
bypass surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hyperlipidemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Appendectomy in [**2090**].

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Lipitor 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg
daily, calcium, and a multivitamin daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location 620**] with his wife. [**Name (NI) **]
retired 1 year ago from sales. He drives. He uses no
assistive devices. He is very active. He quit smoking in
[**2116**]. He has a 40-pack-year history. He has 3 alcoholic
drinks per year.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His father died of a MI at the age of 87.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for the symptoms stated
in the HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Height is 5 feet 7
inches. Weight is 177.5 pounds. Vital signs reveal a heart
rate of 78, sinus rhythm, BP of 143/72, respirations of 15.
In general, he was lying flat in bed in no acute distress.
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented x 3, appropriate,
nonfocal. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact. His
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate
was regular in rate and rhythm. Positive S1 and S2. No
clicks, rubs, murmurs, or gallops. His abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended. Round with positive bowel
sounds. His extremities were warm and well perfused. Negative
edema or varicosities. His pulses were 2+ throughout, and he
had no carotid bruits.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count was 9.4,
hematocrit was 37.7, and platelets were 252. Sodium was 138,
potassium was 3.7, chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 24, BUN
was 26, creatinine was 0.9, and blood glucose was 164. PT of
13.3, PTT of 28.3, and INR of 1.1. ALT of 17, AST of 25,
amylase of 72, total bilirubin of 0.6, albumin of 3.8,
alkaline phosphatase of 122.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  His preoperative chest x-ray showed no
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. It did show some
small calcified subcentimeter lung nodules at the left base.

The cardiac catheterization results were mentioned in the
HPI.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After obtaining consent for bypass surgery
from the patient he was brought to the operating room the
next (on [**2154-3-15**]) and underwent coronary artery bypass
graft x 4 with a LIMA to the LAD, a saphenous vein graft to
diagonal, a saphenous vein graft to the OM, a saphenous vein
graft to the RCA. The patient tolerated the procedure well
with a total cardiopulmonary bypass time of 148 minutes. He
had a mean arterial pressure in transfer to CSICU of 68, CVP
of 23, PA diastolic of 21, PA mean of 25, it was 92 A paced.
He was being titrated on Neo-Synephrine and propofol en route
to the unit. Later that day propofol was weaned. The patient
became less sedated. As he became alert and awake his ET tube
was removed. His was following all commands and moving all
extremities. He was neurologically intact.

On postoperative day 1, he appeared to be doing well. He was
hemodynamically stable. Beta blockade and diuretics were
started per protocol. His PA catheter was removed, and he was
transferred to the telemetry floor.

On postoperative day #2, the patient appeared to be doing
well. He had some rales in the left base. Otherwise, his
physical exam was unremarkable. His mediastinal chest tube
was removed.

On postoperative day #3, all remaining chest tubes were
removed. As well as his epicardial pacing wires and his Foley
were removed. His physical exam was now unremarkable. He no
longer had rales in his lungs. His O2 saturation was improved
since yesterday when it was 95 at 5 liters. He continued to
get out of bed and ambulate well. Throughout his
postoperative course he was being seen by physical therapy,
and they were assessing his status and getting him out of bed
and improving his activity level.

On postoperative day #4, his magnesium was repleted. His
lungs did appear to have some inspiratory wheezes and
crackles bilaterally (right greater than left). The patient
was encouraged to continue using inspiratory spirometry.

On postoperative day #5, the patient was at level 5 activity
level. He appeared well enough to go home. He was
hemodynamically stable. He still had some scattered rhonchi
but was discharged with Lasix and to continue to be diuresed
for a week.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was discharged to home with VNA
services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Status post coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 on [**3-15**], [**2153**].
3. Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Potassium chloride 10-mEq capsules
2 capsules b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg

.
The patient describes 2 types of pain. The first pain is a R
sternal pain that occurs while eating and is usually relieved
with physical massage. She reports having this pain for years.
.
The second type of pain started 2 days ago, but has not recurred
now for more than 24 hours.   She reports having epigastric
chest pain 2 days prior to admission that lasted for a whole
day.  She also noted pain in her R arm at the same time.  Denies
associated N/V, diaphoresis, or sob.  No recent change in
weight, LE swelling, or PND. Patient did have some mild cough
with yellow productive sputum, but no f/c.  She also c/o chronic

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2152-3-17**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two vessel coronary
artery disease.  The left main coronary artery was short with no
angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The LAD had
moderate diffuse disease with a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel
and a 70% stenosis at the origin of the first diagonal.  The LCX
had an OM1 upper pole with a 99% stenosis and slow flow.  The
LCX had a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel.  The RCA was small in
caliber and had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics were performed upon entry.
Systemic arterial pressure was moderately elevated (aortic
pressure was 160/73mmHg).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
.
CT ABDOMEN [**2152-3-17**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
1. Small hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusion.
3. No evidence of reteroperitoneal bleed.
4. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.
5. Atrophic kidneys. Not significantly changed form CT from [**4-14**], [**2148**].
.
ECHO [**2152-3-17**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function
appears depressed with lateral hypokinesis (regional wall motion
not fully assessed). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
CXR [**2152-3-20**]: (PRELIMINARY REPORT)
2 views of the chest compared to a single view done 4 days
earlier. There are no focal infiltrates or definite effusions.
Mediastinum and bony structures are unchanged including findings
consistent with rotator cuff disease involving the right
shoulder. There is also marked aortic tortuosity and prominence,
this is also unchanged. Over the cervical prevertebral area,
there is a superimposed air which likely represents the trachea
as well as the piriform sinuses. Please correlate clinically in
this patient with fever.
.
CT chest (non-contrast): 1. Extensive aortic and coronary
atherosclerosis with suspected descending thoracic aorta
dissection and intraluminal thrombus, stable. This study is not
dedicated to evaluation of the vascular system and additional
examination might be considered.

2. Right lower lobe atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 78 year-old woman with a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure,
end stage renal disease (not yet on hemodialysis) who was
transfered from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 628**] for management of NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI: The patient was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation MI
at the outside hospital. She underwent cardiac catheterization
on [**2152-3-17**] showing 2 vessel disease(LAD 70%, D1 70%; LCx 70%, OM1
99%).  During cath, the cardiologists were unable to cross the
LCx/OM1 lesion with the wire.  CT surgery was called for
evaluation of possible surgical revascularization given the
inability to perform PCI.  Plavix was held given this
consideration of surgical revascularization in the future.  She
was continued on aspirin and statin.  The patient was not on a
betablocker as an outpatient; however, this was not started
initially after cath due to hypotension (see below). Her
hypotension resolved, and a beta blocker was started.  Because
of ongoing fevers and clinical pneumonia, CABG was deferred and
the pt was discharged home with instructions to follow-up with
CT surgery for CABG in several weeks.
.
# HYPOTENSION:  Approximately 2 hours after catheterization, the
patient was noted to have an asymptomatic low blood pressure of
74/47.  IV fluid bolus was started immediately with some
response and her SBP rose to the mid-80's.  The cardiology team,
including the interventional cardiology attending, and the
attending of record were present to evaluate the patient.  A
stat bedside echo was done given concern for
dissection/perforation since there was difficulty attempting to
cross LCx/OM lesion during cath.  This echo revealed a small
amount of fluid in pericardial space; however, there was no
evidence of tamponade.  The patient was given Atropine given due
to concern for vagal response since she still had a femoral
sheath in place.  She responded to this medication with good
response in her blood pressure (SBP rose from the 80's to
100's); however, this was only a transient response.  A stat
hematocrit was sent given concern for retroperitoneal bleeding.
This value was stable was stable.  She was given a total 1.5L
bolus of normal saline.  The patient was then transferred to the
CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to the CCU, her BP continued to fall, and more
atropine was given (total 1.2mg) along with a dopamine infusion
for augmentation of blood pressure. A triple lumen catheter was
placed in her right femoral vein, and 2 units of PRBCs were
transfused.  She was taken for an emergent CT abdomen once her
MAP was consistently above 65 while on dopamine drip.
Neosynephrine was added for a short period en route to CT, but
was titrated off during the scan.  This CT scan of the abdomen
and pelvis was negative for a retroperitoneal bleed.  On return
to the CCU, an arterial line was placed. The pt. became somewhat
delerious and agitated and was given Haldol 1mg x2 and 0.25 mg
lorazepam x2 for sedation.
.
She did well overnight with improvement in her blood pressure.
Dopamine was titrated off at 12am (total duration approximately
4 hours).   After weaning dopamine, the patient maintained her
blood pressure well in the range of 104-143/50-76.
.
The etiology of her hypotension was thought to be secondary to a
vagal response due to her femoral sheath.  Once her blood
pressure stabilized, she was started on a low dose betablocker.
She remained with normal blood pressure throughout the remainder
of her stay.
.
# FEVER: The patient spiked temperature overnight on [**2152-3-19**]. She
denied all infectious symptoms.  Her WBC count was normal.  UA
was negative, blood cultures show no growth to date.  CXR did
not show evidence of pneumonia, however pt had adventitious lung
sounds on exam. She continued to spike fevers for several days,
and then became mildly hypoxic, so she was started on
levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.
.
# END STAGE RENAL DISEASE: The patient is not yet on
hemodialysis.  During this admission, her creatinine bumped
slightly from 2.4 to 2.8.  Her FeNa was less than 1%.  She was
likely prerenal with a component of contrast nephropathy from
the catheterization. Her creatinine promptly improved from 2.8
back to her baseline of 2.4.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: She was placed on lipitor 80mg daily given her
NSTEMI.
.
# HTN: She is on norvasc as an outpatient.  This was held
initially due to her hypotension.  She was later started on a
low dose of metoprolol given her NSTEMI, and her norvasc was
discontinued. Her ACEI was also held both during the admission
and upon discharge due to her renal dysfunction and upcoming
CABG.
.
# DEPRESSION: She was continued on Zoloft.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: She was continued on her outpatient dose of
levothyroxine.
.
# CODE: she was originally DNR/DNI, however after further
discussion with the pt, she decided to be Full Code.

History of Present Illness:
This 75 year old lady with remarkable past medical history with
stage III lung cancer, treated about 7 years ago with
chemo/radio therapy, managed to survive without recurrence of
the cancer on recent extensive investigations when she presented
with aortic stenosis.  Her investigation included angiogram and
echo
which basically showed severe aortic stenosis with calcified
tricuspid aortic valve and significant disease in the right
coronary artery and also a patent foramen ovale and mild mitral
regurgitation.

Her past medical history as mentioned above includes the lung
cancer, stage III, with also subsequent right sided pleural
effusion as well as pericardial effusion for which she had
pericardiocentesis in the past.  She thoroughly investigated
with PET scan, etc to rule out possibility of any secondaries
which were all negative.  After full discussion, she wanted to
go ahead with the surgery.  She was electively admitted for
aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, and
patent foramen ovale closure.

CXR [**2117-8-16**]
1. Findings consistent with cardiomegaly and interstitial
pulmonary edema.

2. Nodular densities within the right upper lobe and volume loss
in the right upper lobe. Although these findings could be due to
prior granulomatous disease, further evaluation is necessary.
Recommend comparison with prior studies. If no prior studies are
available, non-contrast CT of the chest is recommended.

3. Two compression fractures of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
The acuity of these fractures cannot be determined. Clinical
correlation recommended.

[**2117-8-31**] CXR
Comparison with [**2117-8-30**]. In the interval, the Dobhoff tube
has been removed. There is a large amount of air underneath the
diaphragms; a PEG tube appears to be in place in the left upper
quadrant. The appearance of the lungs is not significantly
changed. A right-sided dual lead pacemaker, midline sternotomy
wires, staples overlying the heart, a tracheostomy tube, a right
internal jugular catheter, are all in place. Surrounding osseous
structures are unchanged. Findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

differentiation to suggest a large minor or major vascular
territorial infarct is identified, although MR is a more

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-8-17**] and taken
directly to the operating room where she underwent an aortic
valve replacement and an atrial septal defect closure.
Postoperatively she was taken to the surgical intensive care
unit for monitoring. She was noted to have severe facial and
neck edema for which diuresis was initiated. Her permenant
pacemaker was interoggated by the electrophysiology service and
reprogrammed. An underlying atrial fibrillation was noted. A
heparin induced thrombocytopenia was sent for thrombocytopenia
which was negative. On [**2117-8-22**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was extubated however
promptly developed respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
The neurology service was consulted for anisocoria. A head CT
scan was obtained which showed small areas of hypodensity within
the left frontal lobe and right frontoparietal region, as well
as within the subcortical white matter and corona radiata
bilaterally. Her anisocoria subsequently resolved. Given her
decreased level of consciouseness, the stroke service felt that
she liklely experienced a cerebrovascular accident and coumadin
should be started when it was safe. The thoracic surgery service
was consulted for a tracheostomy. It was decided that she was
indeed a candidate for a tracheostomy however given her history
of radiation, an open procedure may be best. While changing a
central line, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive which responded to
resuscitation. The electrophysiology service was asked to
evaluate her pacemaker which was found to be functioning within
normal limits. Slight changes were made to her sensing. Rate
control of her atrial fibrillation was recommended. The physical
therapy worked with Mrs. [**Known lastname **] daily. On [**2117-8-25**], the thoracic
surgery service performed a tracheostomy without complication. A
bronchoscopy was later performed which did not reveal
significant secretions. The ventilator was slowly weaned to
CPAP. The speech and swallow service was consulted. As she had
not tolerated a passe muir valve, a bedside swallowing
evaluation was defferred and a PEG feeding tube was recommended.
A PEG was placed on [**2117-8-31**] for long term nutrition needs. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] continued to experience episodes of hypotension which
responded to pressors. Most of her episodes seemed to be related
to atrial fibrillation which was aggressively controlled with
amiodarone. As she was subtherapeutic on coumadin, heparin was
started as a bridge. Her neurologic status improved and she was
able to move all extremities to commmand. She began to tolerate
her tube feeds and continued to improve over the next several
days, using her trach collar. CVL was discontinued on [**9-8**] and
INR was therapeutic [**Company 57359**] 98.0, 95/46, V paced at 81, RR 30
SIMV, 5 peep, 10 pressure support, 40%, alert, awake and
comfortable. Trach site C/D/I, RRR, no murmur, lungs CTA
bilat,sternal incision C/D/I, abdomen has minimal distention,
nontender, no c/c/e of extremities, foley cath in place.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to [**Hospital **] rehabilitation on [**2117-9-8**]. She will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male who
presented to an outside hospital two days prior to admission
complaining of substernal chest pain increasing over a 2-week
period which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin.  He
ruled out for a myocardial infarction at the outside hospital
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for elective cardiac catheterization which showed a left main
stenosis of 70 percent, a left circumflex stenosis of 90 to
99 percent, and a RCA stenosis of 90 percent at that time and
was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, history of
breast cancer, myelodysplasia, benign prostatic hypertrophy,
right bundle branch block, hemorrhoids, left ankle
dislocation, hypertension, osteoarthritis, hiatal hernia, and
glaucoma.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Norvasc 5 mg once daily, atenolol
25 mg once daily, Imdur 30 mg once daily, Neurontin 900 mg
once daily, allopurinol 300 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg once
daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, doxazosin 4 mg once daily,
Alphagan eye drops 0.15 percent 1 drop right eye twice daily,
Timolol 0.5 percent 1 drop right eye in the morning, and
aspirin 81 mg once daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Name (NI) 3494**].  A positive history of tobacco (60-pack-year);
quit 30 years prior and denies alcohol use or abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The temperature was
97.5, the heart rate was 65, the blood pressure was 164/68,
the respiratory rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 96
percent on room air.  Neurologically, alert and oriented
times three.  In no acute distress.  The neck was supple
without bruits.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate
and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  No jugular
venous distention noted.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Gastrointestinal examination
revealed soft, positive bowel sounds, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremities revealed right groin
catheterization site without hematoma.  Distal dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses palpable.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was
15.2, hematocrit was 44.8, and platelets were 143.  Sodium
was 138, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 102, bicarbonate was
29, blood urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.9, and
glucose was 111.  Negative urinalysis preoperatively.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on
[**2176-2-9**] and found to have 3-vessel disease by
cardiac catheterization.  He was worked up for coronary
artery bypass grafting.  On [**2176-2-12**] he proceeded to
the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times four with a LIMA to the
LAD, a saphenous vein graft to the ramus, a saphenous vein
graft to the PL, and a saphenous vein graft to the PDA.

Once the case was completed he was noted to have an increased
amount of bleeding.  He was reopened and re-explored in the
Operating Room. He also received multiple blood products in
the Operating Room.  Please see the Operative Note for
complete details.  He was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Room on the evening of [**2-12**], A-paced at a rate
of 70 on a Neo-Synephrine drip.

On postoperative day one, he continued on a ventilator,
unable to wean, with a chest x-ray showing a left-sided fluid
collection.  He already had mediastinal and left anterior
chest tubes.  Therefore, a left posterior chest tube was
placed with a fair amount of sanguineous drainage removed.

On postoperative day two, his respiratory status improved but
he still required ventilatory support and was not extubated.
He was also noted to have a significantly elevated white
blood cell count up to 60, and a Hematology consultation was
obtained.  The Hematology Service had no big recommendations
as to the source or treatment of the elevated white blood
cell count, and by postoperative day three his white count
had decreased to 24.

On postoperative day three, Mr. [**Known lastname 41554**] respiratory status
improved; however, thick green sputum was suctioned from his
endotracheal tube and sent for cultures.  In the afternoon,
he was weaned and successfully extubated.  His chest tube
drainage significantly decreased, and all of his chest tubes
were also removed.

On the evening between postoperative days three and four, Mr.
[**Known lastname 3501**] had some atrial fibrillation for which he was started
on amiodarone and beta blockade; which he subsequently
converted to a normal sinus rhythm.  Also on postoperative
day four, he was found to be recovering well and safe for
transfer to the inpatient floor for further recovery and
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day five, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] had additional bursts of
rapid atrial fibrillation; treated with intravenous Lopressor
as well as his oral amiodarone and Lopressor doses.  It was
decided that he should be anticoagulated and was started on a
heparin drip and oral Coumadin.  His cardiac pacing wires
were also removed on postoperative day five.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**]
continued to have coarse lungs with a productive cough;
however, his sputum changed to yellow and no infection has
been identified.

On postoperative day six, he was noted to have some serous
sternal drainage treated with Betadine swabs and dry sterile
dressing.

On postoperative day seven, Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] was noted to have a
continued scant amount of serous drainage from his sternal
incision.  He had an elevated white count up to 33, and he
was therefore started on vancomycin intravenously, and a PICC
line was placed for potential long-term antibiotic
administration.

On postoperative day nine, Mr. [**Known lastname 41554**] INR was elevated to
1.9; at which time his heparin drip was discontinued and he
continued on his oral Coumadin.  His sternal drainage on
postoperative days nine and ten was also noted to be
significantly decreased.  It was decided that he would
continue on the vancomycin.

Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] was followed by Physical Therapy throughout his
hospital course, and it was decided that he was not safe for
home and should continue with physical therapy and
rehabilitation at a rehabilitation facility.  He will be
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2176-2-23**].

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 105043**] is a 46F with PMH significant for FSGS s/p live
donor renal transplant in [**2182**], on CSA and prednisone, with h/o
ureteral stricture s/p multiple stentings by urology service,
last in [**3-9**]. She presents today with few days h/o RLQ pain
(over transplanted kidney site), chills, and dysuria, with
nausea, but no vomiting. She did have some non-bloody loose
stools 2 days ago, for which she took immodium x 1, and
resolved. She was also noted to have worsening of her her renal
function, with elevation of her BUN/Cr to 35/3.0, from baseline
creatinine 2.2. Her creatinine has been gradually worsening over
the past year, from 1.8 in [**4-7**] to 2.2 on [**2197-3-8**], to 2.5 on
[**2197-4-26**]. She last saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] in clinic in [**3-9**], at which
point he asked her to decrease her CSA dose from 100mg PO bid to
100mg PO qD alternating with 200mg PO qD; however, per her
report, she has continued to take 100mg PO bid. Last CSA level
264 on [**4-26**].
.
In the ED, her initial VS were T 99.3F, BP 170/82, HR: 105, RR:
18, Satting 94% on RA. She was found to have a slightly elevated
wbc to 11.1 (68% PMN), and, as above, BUN/Cr of 35/3.0. A
transplant renal U/S was done, which demonstrated no evidence of
hydronephrosis, normal vascular flow and indices, and no fluid
collections. Lactate was 1.8. UA demonstrated small blood, small
LE, neg nitr, 3-5wbc with 0-2rbc, few bacteria, 0 epi. A repeat
UA was sent, which was similar, except demonstrating 0-2 wbc.
Renal service saw her in the ED, and recommended Levofloxacin
500mg PO x 1, followed by 250mg PO q48h, and 1L NS, which she
received. Pt deferred pelvic exam. Also recommended were urine
lytes (FENa 1.95%), LFTs/amylase/lipase, which were pending at
time of admission, and transplant surgery consult, who were
notified of her admission. She was admitted to the hepatorenal
service for further inpatient management.

Imaging Studies:
[**2197-6-19**]: Renal US - No evidence of hydronephrosis.
.
[**2197-6-23**]: Echo - IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular global and
regional systolic function. Small pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2197-6-26**]: CT C/A/P - IMPRESSION:
1) No perinephric fluid collections or hematoma surrounding the
transplanted kidney.
2) Air in the collecting system of the transplanted kidney and
bladder as
   described above.
3) Endotracheal tube position approximately 1cm from the carina.

.
[**2197-7-12**]: CT A/P - IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse small bowel dilatation.  Contrast passes throughout
the colon to the rectum at the time of imaging.  Findings are
most consistent with an ileus. If there is concern for
developing small bowel obstruction, serial abdominal radiographs
are reccomended.
2.  New small amount of ascites around the liver.
3.  Residual droplets of air in the transplant renal collecting
system and
bladder.  Nephroureteral stent in place.  No hydronephrosis of
the transplant.
.
[**2197-7-5**]: Echo -
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion with no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2197-8-2**]: Portable CXR - PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Compared
to prior radiograph from [**2197-7-25**].  The area of
consolidation in the right lower lobe has resolved and now
remains residual atelectasis.  The left retrocardiac opacity
persists and likely represents consolidated portions of lung.
No pleural effusions are seen.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema is seen.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Tracheostomy tube is
seen in appropriate position.  The tip of the left PICC line
overlies the expected region of the mid SVC.
.
IMPRESSION:  Resolution of right lower lobe consolidation, now
with residual atelectasis.  Persistent left lower
lobe/retrocardiac consolidation.
.
.
Pathology:
[**2197-6-21**]: Renal allograft biopsy - Chronic allograft nephropathy.
There is no evidence of acute cellular rejection in this sample.
 The differential diagnosis also includes ""acute tubular
necrosis"", obstruction, and drug nephrotoxicity.  Cortical
sample size is quite limited, and may not be representative of
the organ.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 46F with h/o FSGS s/p liver donor renal transplant
c/b ureteral stricture s/p multiple stentings, presenting with
few days of RLQ pain, chills, and dysuria, and elevation in
creatinine.
.
Her initial course on the medical floor was notable for
persistent acute renal failure.  She was cultured and eventually
underwent a renal biopsy that showed chronic allograft
nephropathy.  After the renal biopsy pt was noted to have
decreased hct from 40-30, was given 2.5 liters of fluid through
the day, then received 1U PRBC finished at 12am, triggered at
4am for hypoxia, noted to desat to 60s, placed on NRB with
increase of o2 sat to 80s, o/w VS were 98.8 112 144/90  rr 40,
satting 80s on NRB.  abg performed showed 7.26/47/74.  pt given
40 lasix with increase UO of 140cc/hr then another 200 lasix.
She was treated supportively for possible TRALI and placed on
bipap with increases in her oxygenation to 95%.  The remainder
of her course will be by problem.
.
#. Respiratory failure: Felt to be initially be [**1-5**] to TRALI (as
happened around 48 hours after transfusion) did not improve with
diuresis and CXR findings also suggestive.  However, ultimate
work up by blood bank was not consistent with this diagnosis.
She was intubated within 12hours of the acute failure on [**6-25**]
and vent settings changed to ARDSNet protocol for lung
protective strategy. A discussion was taken with blood bank and
it seems likely that this was trali initially based on initial
clinical course, but the clinical picutre was confusing given
prolonged course. This incidentally does not effect the ability
to get future transfusions. Her respiratory decompensated
further while on the vent with fevers, elevated WBC and increase
production sputum. MSSA grew from sputum and BAL, and she was
treated initially on vanco and Zosyn but swithced to Nafcillin
on [**7-7**] when sputum returned with MSSA. She was swithced back to
Vancomycin after a Coag negative staph came back in her urine
and completed a total of 8 days of vancomycin.  She remained
difficult to wean, felt mainly to be due to volume overload,
agitation requiring heavy sedation (as below) and dense
consolidations from the above MSSA-ventilator associated
pneumonia.  As her respiratory failure persisted, a tracheostomy
and J-tube placement was performed on [**7-14**].  From there, a vent
weaned continued, moving her at first to pressure support and
slowly decreasing the support daily.  The wean was delayed by a
recurrent MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia, treated with an
eight-day course of vancomycin (and briefly cefepime for the
first few days; this was stopped after a few days, as below, as
she was felt to be allergic to naficillin).  At the time of
discharge, she continued to require intermittent ventilatory
support, but was doing well for hours at a time on trach mask.
While on the ventilator, she appeared quite comfortable on
pressure support of [**9-7**] with 40%fio2, with rr's around 18 and
tidal volumes easily in the 500's. The last few days the patient
has been undergoing trach mask trials. On [**2197-7-31**] she tolerated
12 hours, 5 hours on [**2197-8-1**], and only a few minutes on
[**2197-8-2**]. On [**2197-8-2**] she was placed back on CPAP/PS because of
desat to low 80s. Of note, the last few days prior to discharge
patient has been having low grade temp to 100.5, although
afebrile last 24 hours. Repeat CXR on [**2197-8-2**] revealed
resolution of previously identified right LL opacification but
persistent left retrocardiac opacity. If the patient spikes a
temperature again, consideration should be made towards repeat
treatment of VAP.
.
#. Renal failure: The intial renal failure with which she was
admitted was felt to probably be due to ATN and resolved on its
own back to a baseline Cr of 1.7-2.0.  She was continued on her
mycophenolate 500mg po bid and prednisone 5mg daily.  However,
on [**7-26**] in the setting of a drug rash, fever, and eosinophilia,
as below, her Cr worsened, eventually peaking at 3.1 on [**7-28**].
This was felt to be due to acute interstitial nephritis; this
responded well to high dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg tid x
1 day, then moved to [**Hospital1 **], now 25mg [**Hospital1 **]), with rapid improvement
in Cr back to 1.6 on the day of discharge.  As requested by the
renal transplant service, the patient will now be discharged on
Prednisone 5mg po bid and CellCept 500mg IV bid. It has been
requested that the patient have follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
transplant within one week at which time decisions towards
appropriate immunsuppressive therapy will be made. The patient
should have Chem panel performed two to three times weekly to
monitor renal function. If there are any abnormalities noted,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] should be notified please at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 49911**].
.
#. Allergic reaction:  On [**7-23**], Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 105044**] was noted to have
a truncal erythematous macular rash that became increasingly
intense and confluent, spreading to her face and down her
extremities.  She also began spiking fevers and, as above,
developed worsening renal function.  Dermatology saw the rash
and felt that naficillin most likey caused this reaction and
that it was worsening because of the cefepime, which was
subsequently stopped.  On high dose steroids (mainly started for
probably AIN) and topcial triamcinolone, her rash improved.  She
was not given any further beta-lactam based medications.
.
#. Leukopenia: On [**7-25**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 105043**] unexpectedly became
leukopenic, dropping her WBC from 10 to 2.  Hematology was
consulted and they felt that this was probably medication
related. Her leukopenia has since resolved.
.
#. Agitation - During her period of ventilation, prior to wean
attempts, the patient was noted to be very agitated, requiring
large doses of Fentanyl, Versed as well as propofol. With
addition of standing Haldol, initially as much as 5mg IV q
6hours plus PRN, the patient was slowly able to be weaned from
sedation over a number of days. She most recently has been
maintained on a Fentanyl 72 hour patch 25mcg/hr, Ativan .5mg [**Hospital1 **]
+ PRN for CIWA > 10 (with little need for PRNs) and Haldol has
been decreased to 5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Weaning attempts have been
complicated by agitation with difficulty dissociating
respiratory discomfort/distress from agitation. it is suspected
that some of her agitation earlier was secondary to withdrawal
from narcotics and benzos given the large amounts she was
requiring previously for adequate sedation while vented. Ongoing
efforts should be made to decrease her Ativan, and Haldol as
possible from standing to PRNs only to off. As mentioned above,
additional consideration towards worsening respiratory status
should be made given persistent left retrocardiac opacity
(atelectasis vs. small effusion vs. PNA)
.
#. Ileus - The patient was intially noted to have some abdominal
pain and distention. CT imaging revealed an ileus, likely
secondary to large opiate requirements. With weaning of sedation
and a trial of Naloxone PO to increase bowel motility, the
patient's Ileus resolved. She is now tolerating tube feeds at
goal of 55/hr.

(of note: after patient was discharged, dose of cellcept changed
to 500mg IV bid per renal. This was communicated to the
receiving rehab)

CXR ([**2159-9-2**]):
1. Marked cardiomegaly, stable.
2. Interval improvement in the degree of congestive heart
failure with a tiny right pleural effusion.
3. Stable appearance of the transvenous pacemaker and leads.

CT Torso ([**2159-9-2**]):
1. Likely small subsegmental nonocclusive lingular pulmonary
embolus.
2. Heterogeneous right nephrogram, new from [**2159-7-31**], is
pyelonephritis versus renal infarcts.
3. A moderate right pleural effusion. (enlarged from [**2159-7-31**]), and small ascites (relatively unchanged).
.
Echo [**2159-9-3**]:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2159-6-12**],the findings are
similar.

The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. No definite
thrombus identified (cannot definitively exclude). Spontaneous
echo contrast is noted in the left heart consistent with slow
flow. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is moderate
to severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year-old M with nonischemic dilated CMP with EF<20%, multiple
VTE (DVT/PE) who presents with persistent epigastric pain
initially admitted to medicine, transfered to the MICU due to
hypotension on the same day, then CCU the next day for further
management of CHF (tailored therapy).  His hospital course for
this admission is as follows:
.
1 CHF: Severe systolic CHF with EF <20% with moderate MR,
hypotension likely secondary to poor cardiac output.   We
continued his digoxin at home dose.  Central line was placed,
and he was started on dobutamine drip tailored therapy at
15/kg/min on [**2159-9-4**] which was gradually weaned to 12mcg/kg/min
on [**2159-9-6**], and weaned completely on [**2159-9-7**] and his central
line was pulled on the same day.  We monitored him closely for
arrythmias on the tele while he was on the dobutamine drip.
Lasix, [**Last Name (un) **], and spironolactone was held initially given
increased Cr, while he was at the CCU, [**Last Name (un) **] (valsartan 40''),
lasix 40', aldactone 25' was restarted once his Cr function was
back to his baseline.  He was held on most of his heart failure
meds given BP parameter setting (SBP<95), but we adjusted the
parameter to hold meds for SBP<85, and the decision was made not
to take him for right heart cath at the time since he was able
to tolerate his heart failure meds with changing parameters.  He
was discharged home with valsartan 40mg PO qhs, lasix 80mg PO
qday, aldactone 25mg PO qday, digoxin 0.125mg PO qday.
.
2 Ischmia. No CP, no h/o CAD. initial troponin and CK negative.
.
3 Rhythm. pt had sinus tach, likely [**3-1**] to low cardiac output,
anticipate improvement.
.
4 Abdominal Pain. Leading diagnosis is congestion from CHF
causing pain from liver capsule expansion. Somewhat responsive
to PPI. He continued to complained abdominal pain while in the
hopsital, and seemed to improved with pain management.  CT torso
initially was unrevealing.  We followed his daily LFTs, which
continued to be mildly elevated but stable c/w with liver
congestion from his heart failure.
.
5 DVT/PE. Unclear etiology. RUE VTE developed at home, not in
setting of line placement. Patient now developed a small PE
while supratherapeutic on coumadin. Concerning for
hypercoagulable state. Hem/Onc was consulted, but was difficult
to send hypercoagulable stuides given patient already
anticoagulated; we sent antiphospholipid Ab which was WNL, pt
didn't carry the more common factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] mutation and
Prothrombin mutations, homocysteine levels was WNL;  His
initially INR was supratherapeutic 4.0->3.5, coumadin was held
initially; coumadin was restarted at 3mg PO qhs when INR came
down to 2.5.  Given Echo showed questionable LV thrombus and
given ? hx of hypercoagulable state, he was also started on
Lovenox 60mg SC q12h when INR became undertherapeutic (INR<2.0)
while on Coumadin.  He also finished a 7 day course for Kefelx
for superifical thrombophlebitis.
 .
6 R renal infarct. Noted on CT torso, new finding which was
concerning for thromboembolic disease, possibly LV thrombus give
dilated CMP predisposing to intracardiac stasis. Echo aslo
suggestive of poor flow. No clots seen on echo however. No
evidence of endocarditis given no fevers, bl cx negative to date
from ED.   We continued anticoagulation with coumadin and
lovenox (when INR<2.0), and monitored renal function closely
where Cr trending down to baseline.
.
7 Cr elevation. Baseline 1.0, initially slightly elevated
secondary to poor cardiac output +/- renal infarct. anticipate
improvement with improved cardiac output on pressors. We held
lasix and [**Last Name (un) **] initially given slightly elevated BUN/Cr; once Cr
back to his baseline, [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix was restarted.
.
8 Pain syndrome. Multifactorial, mainly around his ICD site (no
signs of infection and remained afebrile thorughout the hospital
course) and abdomen (most likely related to congestive
hepatopathy). Chronic pain service was consulted, which
recommended oxycodone 5-15mg PO q4h prn, tradmadol 50mg PO q4-6h
prn, and gabapentin 600mg PO tid, and lidocaine 5% patch 12
hours on and 12 hours off. Patient's pain slightly improved on
this regimen.
.
9 Congestive hepatopathy. LFTs mildly elevated initally, we
followed closely his daily LFTs, which remained slightly
elevated but stable.
.
10 FEN: cardiac diet, fluid restriction 1500ml/day, lyte
repletion prn
.
11 PPx: INR elevated initially, once therapeutic, started
coumadin (and lovenox and INR<2.0), bowel reg prn, po diet, PPI

[**2181-5-10**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Interval cardiomegaly and fluid overload
indicating mild cardiac failure. Small right pleural effusion.
Followup examination is recommended after appropriate clinical
interval. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by telephone at
time of interpretation.
.
[**2181-5-11**] Cardiac [**Month/Day/Year **]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology; the
right ventricle also appears compressed. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows,
consistent with  impaired ventricular filling.
.
[**2181-5-14**]  Cardiac [**Month/Day/Year **]
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal  (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size

appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a small (1-1.5cm;
?loculated pericardial effusion around the right atrium. No
effusion is seen around the right ventricle or left ventricle.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-12**], the
?loculated
effusion around the right atrium is slightly larger, but
hemodynamic
compromise is not suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 54 year old woman with a past medical history
significant for treated tuberculosis as a child and mild
hypertension who presented to her PCP with shortness of breath.
A PA and Lateral chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and an
admission cardiac [**Month/Day/Year **] revealed a pericardial effusion with
tamponade physiology.  A pericardial drain was placed which
relieved the patient's symptoms.  The patient also had a large
right sided pleural effusion which was drained.  Neither fluid
contained any organisms on gram stain (including specific stains
for tuberculosis).  Cultures had not grown anything at the time
of discharge.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Doctor First Name **] was checked and felt to be non-specific at
1:40.  A TSH was elevated at 6.1 but the free T4 was normal at
1.7.  The patient was never febrile and she never developped an
elevated white blood cell count.
.
Again, the patient's dyspnea resolved with drainage of her
pericardial fluid.  She did have some pain at the pericardial
drainage and thoracentesis sites for which she was treated with
percocet.  She was noted to have an elevated hematocrit, which
was thought to be unrelated to her pericarditis.  It was
determined that she should follow up with her PCP regarding this
issue.  On the day of discharge the patient complained of pain
in her calves bilaterally.  She had spent a significant time in
bed and there was some concern for venous thromboembolism, so
she was sent for bilateral lower extremity ultrasound.  The
results of this demonstrated a distal DVT. As it was
symptomatic, she was started on lovenox and coumadin as
discussed with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 15110**] to frequent urination and
boarderline hyponatremia she was discontinued on HCTZ and began
on Amlodipine. She was discharged with a follow [**Name10 (NameIs) 113**] and follow
up appointments with her PCP and the attending cardiologist.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with
multiple medical cardiac problems, including hypertension,
coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, status
post coronary artery bypass graft, noninsulin dependent
diabetic with retinopathy, neuropathy with a long history of
falls, pacer, carotid occlusion, transient ischemic attacks,
atrial fibrillation and status post right CAA who presented
to the Emergency Room on [**9-19**], status post a fall down 10
stairs with questionable loss of consciousness.  The patient
pushed his Lifeline and was found by EMS.  The patient was
intubated in the field with severe epistaxis upon arrival and
questionable 2 units of blood loss in the field.  The patient
was seen in the trauma bay with severe nasal bleeding,
evaluated by anesthesia for tube placement and found to have
tube in place with pooling of blood in the posterior pharynx.
Patient with multiple contusions on his face.  The patient
was emergently brought to the CT scanner where he was shown
to have a small left tentorial hematoma with a moderate sized
subdural hematoma with a lower density collection extending
over the parietal bone.  There was no significant midline
shift.  He had a bilateral comminuted nasal bone fracture and
possible fracture involving the medial wall of the right
maxillary sinus.  No evidence of cervical spine fracture.
The patient was scanned for abdomen and pelvis which showed a
4.3 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm without rupture.
There was no intraabdominal or intrathoracic injury.  There
was a left groin hematoma involving the adductor muscles.
The patient's nares were packed in the trauma bay.  There was
adequate control of bleeding at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
GENERAL:  The patient was intubated, sedated, multiple facial
injuries, hematomas and nasal bleeding, posterior pharyngeal
blood pooling.  There was no obvious stepoff or deformity or
cervical spine or of the head.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were clear
bilaterally.  The trachea was midline.
CHEST:  Without crepitus, clear, breath sounds bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and dry with good pulses.  The right
forearm was with ecchymosis.
RECTAL:  Negative.

ADMISSION LABS:  White blood cell count of 10, hematocrit of
20.3, platelets of 138.  Coagulation studies were PT of 14.5,
PTT of 32.5, INR of 1.4.  Fibrinogen was 225.  Urine was
negative.  Chemistry showed a sodium of 139, potassium of
3.9, chloride of 97, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 75, creatinine
of 2.6, glucose of 268, initial CK of 110.  Initial digoxin
level was 0.8.

IMAGING:  Initial imaging as noted above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the SICU for
intracranial bleed, nasal bleed and decreased hematocrit with
associated hypotension.  The patient had his right nares
packed with an inflated Foley catheter by ears, nose and
throat.  [**Doctor Last Name 1356**] clamp traction was removed by ears, nose and
throat on the 19th in the a.m.  There was minimal oral
secretions with drainage at the left nares on this day.  The
patient was started on clindamycin for the multiple facial
fractures.  On the 20th, the patient remained intubated and
sedated, moving his right arm on the bed with questionable
continued left arm weakness, moving both extremities in the
bed.  On the 20th, the patient's hematocrit was to 28 with
platelets at 66 and INR of 1.3.  The patient had x-rays of
the right shoulder and bilateral knees without evidence of
fracture.  On the 21st, the patient continued to have no
further changes on neurologic exam, continued with thick
bloody brown oral secretions.  His hematocrit remained
stable, finishing his third dose of vitamin K.  Platelets at
this point were at 107.  At this point, the patient was
weaned off propofol with purposeful movements of all four
extremities.  There was a weak GAG and cough.  Pupils were 3
mm and reactive to light.  The patient was started on
intravenous Lopressor for occasional rates in the 80s.

On the 22nd, the patient was weaned to a pressure support of
15 and PEEP of 5 with several apneic times.  He was placed on
full vent support overnight.  Packing in the right nares
remained in place through the 25th.  On the 24th, the patient
was extubated with difficulty with significant wheezing and
inability to clear secretions.  The patient was acidotic with
hypercarbia.  The patient was re-intubated due to difficult
ventilation at this time.  The patient also had periods of
rapid atrial fibrillation at this point that resolved on
their own.  On the 24th, the patient was started on tube
feeds.  The patient's mental status throughout this course
remained somewhat tenuous with purposeful movements, left
greater than right, nodding to questions yes or no, moving
both his lower extremities in the bed with attempts to get
out of bed.  Full mental status was not clear.  Due to
continued elevated blood sugars, the patient was started on
an insulin drip at 1 unit per hour.  There was discussion of
another attempt to wean to extubate.

On the 27th, the patient was on pressure support of 5, PEEP
of 5, but this was not tolerated with hypercarbia returning.
On the 29th, the discussion of trach and PEG was raised with
the family.  The family discussed this issue and on the 30th
it was determined that a trach and PEG would be done on the
31st.  During a bed side trach, the patient began bleeding
copious amounts into his trachea with desaturation.  The
patient desaturated significantly with elevated heart rate
and dropping blood pressure until the patient became
asystolic approximately one minute.  Chest compressions were
performed with efforts to clear the airway.  The patient did
receive epinephrine and atropine.  The patient was revived
and started on an esmolol drip for rate control and
Neo-Synephrine for pressure support.  The patient remained in
atrial fibrillation with esmolol drip required and then
discharged with intravenous Lopressor for rate control.

On the first, the patient's neurologic status seemed to be
similar to pre-tracheostomy with opening eyes spontaneously,
grimacing to procedures and nodding yes or no to questions.
The patient remained off all antibiotics at this time.
During the tracheostomy, the patient was noted to have a left
pneumothorax and a left chest tube was placed.  The patient's
issue at this point continued to be his atrial fibrillation
with intravenous Lopressor needed for rate control.  There
was a discussion with cardiology regarding management of
chronic atrial fibrillation and question of starting
amiodarone.  After discussion as to whether a TEE would be
necessary prior to chemical conversion and discussions with
the family, it was felt that a TEE would not be prudent at
this time and chemical cardioversion with amiodarone would
not be performed.  Rate control would be performed with beta
blockers or calcium channel blockers as needed.  It was
deemed that the patient was not a candidate for
anticoagulation for obvious reasons.

On the 6th, the patient was converted to p.o. Lopressor and
remained on a trach collar with q 2 to 4 hour suctioning.  It
was deemed appropriate to be transferred to the medical
surgical floor for continued care.  However, on the evening
of transfer, the patient returned to rapid atrial
fibrillation with continued copious secretions with
suctioning and significant nursing care required.  Therefore,
the patient was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit
for rapid atrial fibrillation and nursing care.  The patient
has remained in the Intensive Care Unit getting q2h
suctioning with clear occasionally blood tinged secretions.
He was started on a Diltiazem drip on his second SICU
admission with conversion of intravenous Diltiazem to p.o.
Diltiazem on the 7th without difficulty.  He has remained in
good rate control on p.o. Diltiazem.  On the day of
dictation, the patient remained stable without continued
episodes of atrial fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
male who fell down a flight of about approximately 10 stairs.
He was able to press his Lifeline and was found by EMS at the
bottom of the stairs.  The patient was intubated at the scene
by EMS and had a head CT on arrival that was positive for
right subdural hematoma with minimal mass effect.  He did
have significant facial trauma with severe epistaxis and
multiple facial fractures.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
complicated by prolonged Intensive Care Unit stay, rapid
atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure.  A PEG and trach
was done and the trach was complicated by an asystolic
arrest.  The patient was seen by both the neurosurgical
service, renal service, as well as the cardiology service.
The patient's atrial fibrillation was eventually rate
controlled with Diltiazem.  His renal function range during
his hospital course rose from a low of 2.1 to a high of about
3.4.  His hospital course was further complicated by
respiratory failure and inability to wean from the vent.  The
patient did tolerate trach collar for a short course,
however, secondary to left lower lobe collapse and decreasing
two sets required to be put back on CPAP.  The patient was
also noted throughout the course of his admission to have
guaiac positive stools.  He was also seen by gastrointestinal
who declined any intervention at this time.  He is on
Protonix 40 mg per G-tube q.d.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Delerium tremens.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 22 year-old
female brought into the Emergency Room by EMS after [**Location (un) **]
police entered her apartment after someone called for
disorderly conduct.  She was found by police intoxicated with
multiple bruises.  In the Emergency Room the patient was at
first lucent with complaints of back pain and claims that she
fell a lot while she was drinking.  She admitted to drinking
large amounts of alcohol with vomiting.  In the Emergency
Room the patient soon became agitated with delirium and
reported hallucinations.  She was very tremulous.  She was
given Ativan 5 mg intravenous times four and Valium 5 mg as
well as a banana bag with vitamins.

kept NPO and received an abdominal ultrasound, which showed
an echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.  The
patient also found to be anemic with a macrocytic anemia
likely due to alcohol use.  Iron studies were normal as well
as B-12 and folate.  The patient was seen by social work to
discus domestic violence issues.  A psychiatric consult was
also ordered to evaluate the patient's mental status and
capacity to make decisions.  Psychiatry pronounced the
patient with impaired judgement secondary to delirium and
declared her unable to demonstrate that she understands the
risk to her health.  As a result when the patient wanted to
leave AMA she was not allowed.  A one to one sitter was
established for the patient.  Social work continued to follow
with the patient throughout her admission.  The patient
continued to deny domestic violence in her home and stated
she felt very safe there.  The patient expressed interest in
alcohol rehab program, however, did not wish to enter one in
the hospital while an inpatient.  The patient wished to
receive information about outpatient programs so she could
return to school.

The patient continued to do well and was transferred to the
regular medicine floor [**Hospital1 139**] firm on [**2156-7-10**].  She had
begun eating while in Intensive Care Unit, had decreased her
Ativan requirement greatly.  Her pancreatic enzymes and liver
function tests continued to improve.  Discussions were
continued on the floor about the patient's discharge plans.
She was then with capacity to make decisions per psychiatry.
The patient decided she would go home and look into programs
from there.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman with an extensive history of coronary artery
disease (status post multiple myocardial infarctions) who was
transferred from an outside hospital for cardiac
catheterization.

The following history is per the patient's daughter; as the
patient only speaks Portuguese.  She reports that the patient
had increasing shortness of breath with exertion over the
week prior to admission.  At 1 o'clock a.m. on the morning of
admission, the patient awoke from sleep with acute shortness
of breath.  He decided to present to an outside hospital.  At
approximately 7 o'clock a.m., while driving to the hospital,
the patient developed chest pain.

At the outside hospital, the patient was pain free after
receiving oxygen.  He was found to have a troponin of 76.3, a
creatine kinase of 501, and a CK/MB of 20.8.  The patient was
given a heparin bolus, and the decision was made to transfer
the patient to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.  At that time, the heparin was
discontinued and the patient was started on Integrilin.

Other laboratories from the outside hospital included a
potassium of 3.9, creatinine of 1.4, and a hematocrit of 39.
His arterial blood gas at the outside hospital was 7.46/38/69
on 3 liters nasal cannula.  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia at approximately 110 beats per minute.  Axis was
approximately was 30 degrees.  The patient had poor R wave
progression.  There were a few changes from previous studies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Status post myocardial infarction times two;
(a)  In [**2102-5-16**], the patient had a posterior/inferior
myocardial infarction with a cardiac catheterization showing
70% left anterior descending artery, 98% left circumflex, and
diffuse right coronary artery disease.  The patient had
stenting of the left circumflex and the right coronary
artery.
(b)  In [**2103-4-15**], the patient had an inferoseptal
myocardial infarction with cardiac catheterization showing
70% stenosis in the middle of the left anterior descending
artery, 40% stenosis in the second diagonal, and 70% in-stent
restenosis in the left circumflex which was intervened on.
(c)  A redo catheterization in [**2103-5-16**] showed diffuse
proximal and mid disease in the left anterior descending
artery which was stented.
(d)  the patient subsequently underwent redo catheterization
in [**2104-2-15**] when he was found to have left anterior
descending artery 50% narrowing prior to the stent, the left
circumflex stent was widely patent, and the right coronary
artery stent was widely patent.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a pleasant
Portuguese-speaking gentleman who is married and lives with
his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is a retired box maker.  The patient has an
extensive tobacco history of one pack per day for
approximately 60 years.  He quit smoking in [**2102**].  No history
of alcohol or drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 99 degrees
Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 103/59, his heart rate was
78, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen saturation
was 96% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient
was a mildly obese male in no acute distress with labored
breathing.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  The mucous membranes were
moist.  Neck examination revealed increased jugular venous
pulsation at approximately 12 mm to 14 cm at 30 degrees.
Positive right carotid bruit.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
A regular rate.  There was a [**3-22**] crescendo-decrescendo murmur
with radiation to the axilla.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  There were bibasilar crackles.  No
wheezes.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity
examination revealed 1 to 2+ pitting edema to the patellas
bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed his white blood cell count was 10.9,
his hematocrit was 35.6, and his platelets were 197.  His
prothrombin time was 13.4, his partial thromboplastin time
was 39.3, and his INR was 1.2.  His sodium was 137, potassium

phosphorous was 3.4.  Creatine kinase was 370.  CK/MB was 14.
Troponin was 3.72.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  Cardiac catheterization revealed
two patent left anterior descending artery overlapping
stents.  The left circumflex was patent with very distal
upper branch disease and a large first obtuse marginal.  The
right coronary artery and the AV groove was patent including
proximal stents.  There was an eccentric 40% mid right
coronary artery lesions.  The left anterior descending artery
was stented with a 3.25 X 18 cypher, and the right coronary
artery was stented with a 3 X 13-mm Hepacoat stent.

The patient received 20 mg of intravenous Lasix in the
Catheterization Laboratory with approximately 700 cc of urine
output.

Following the catheterization, the patient completed an
18-hour course of Integrilin.  Throughout the admission, he
was also continued on an aspirin, Plavix, an ACE inhibitor, a
beta blocker, and a statin.

(a)  Rhythm:  The patient was in a sinus rhythm throughout
the admission.  He was monitored continuously on telemetry.

(b)  Myocardium:  The patient had a congestive heart failure
exacerbation on admission to the hospital with increasing
shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and exercise
intolerance over the week prior to admission.  He had a good
diuresis in the Catheterization Laboratory following 40 cc of
intravenous Lasix.  The patient continued to have a good
diuresis over the first one day of admission.  His shortness
of breath resolved, and he felt much better.

The patient had previously had a poor left ventricular
ejection fraction of 20% to 30% on previous echocardiograms.
Therefore, a repeat echocardiogram was performed on [**2108-10-29**].  This revealed a mildly dilated left atrium.  The
right atrium was normal in size.  The left ventricular cavity
was severely dilated.  There were multiple left ventricular
wall motion abnormalities including; mid anterior/akinetic,
mid anterior septal/akinetic, mid inferoseptal/akinetic, mid
inferior/akinetic, mid inferolateral/akinetic, anterior
apex/akinetic, septal apex/akinetic, inferior apex/akinetic,
lateral apex/akinetic, and apex/dyskinetic.  The right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal.
The aortic root was mildly dilated as was the ascending
aorta.  There was no aortic valve stenosis.  There was trace
aortic regurgitation.  Mild-to-moderate 1 to 2+ mitral
regurgitation was seen.  There was borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  The estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction was less than 20%.

Given the patient's history of multiple myocardial
infarctions and very decreased left ventricular ejection
fraction, pacemaker placement was discussed.  It was
determined that this would not be done as an inpatient, but
the patient was to follow up with Electrophysiology.

2.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was
continued on an insulin sliding-scale throughout his
admission with good blood sugar control.

3.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient's creatinine was slightly
elevated at 1.4 prior to catheterization.  Following
catheterization, he received intravenous hydration and
Mucomyst times two.  Subsequently, his creatinine decreased
and was 1.3 at the time of discharge.

4.  HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was continued
on a statin throughout his admission.

5.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on his
ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  He had good blood pressure
control throughout the admission.

6.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  Following diuresis on admission, the
patient's shortness of breath greatly improved.  On the day
of discharge, he was saturating in the mid 90% range on room
air.  In addition, he was able to walk around the unit
without becoming short of breath.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Famotidine 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Gabapentin 100 mg by mouth three times per day.
 5.  Atorvastatin 10 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Alprazolam 0.5 mg by mouth twice per day.
 7.  Moexipril 15 mg by mouth once per day
 8.  Toprol-XL 50 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Glyburide 5 mg by mouth twice per day.
10.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 59 year old female with
diabetes mellitus and known coronary artery disease who was
cathed in [**Month (only) 547**] at [**Hospital6 **].  Cath at that time
showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease, but
patient was elected to be treated medically due to poor
targets.  Since her cardiac catheterization she had two
episodes of heart failure and presented to [**Hospital1 346**] emergency department on [**2126-12-7**], with an acute MI.  Cardiac catheterization was
performed on [**2126-12-7**], the day of admission, which
revealed left main coronary artery disease with 30% stenosis,
diffuse disease of the left anterior descending with 80%
midocclusion.  Left circumflex was occluded.  Mid-right
coronary artery with 40% stenosis and diffuse disease in the
posterior descending artery.  An intra-aortic balloon pump
was placed at that time.  Patient was referred to the cardiac
surgery service for coronary artery bypass grafting.  Patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three on
[**2126-12-10**].  Saphenous vein graft to distal left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to right posterolateral.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 113 minutes.  Total clamp
time was 59 minutes.  Patient was transferred in normal sinus
rhythm at 82 beats per minute, hemodynamically stable, to the
cardiac surgery recovery unit on 0.3 mcg per kg per minute of
milrinone, 1.2 mcg per kg per minute of Neo-Synephrine, 10
mcg per kg per minute of propofol and an insulin drip at 2
units per hour.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease; type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic
retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy;
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 2.0;
peripheral vascular disease status post right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Humulin 25/10, Lasix 40 mg q.d.,
atenolol 100 mg q.d., aspirin, Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d., Ambien
10 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Accupril 10 mg p.o.
q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not have a history of
tobacco use nor does patient have a history of alcohol use or
abuse.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.6, hematocrit 27.8, platelet
count 106.  Sodium 139, potassium 5.2, BUN 46, creatinine
1.2, glucose 201.  Magnesium 2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was extubated on [**2126-12-11**], which was postoperative day one.  On postoperative day
one patient had a low grade temperature of 100.8 with t-max
of 101.7, with an intra-aortic balloon pump still at 1:1, on
Neo-Synephrine at 3.5, off milrinone.  Physical exam benign.
Plan was to wean Neo-Synephrine and wean the balloon pump.

On postoperative day two patient still with low grade
temperature of 100.2 and t-max of 101.7.  Still on
Neo-Synephrine at 0.9.  Intra-aortic balloon pump at 1:2.
White count 9.8, hematocrit 24.5, platelet count 80.  Sodium
139, potassium 4.7, BUN 47, creatinine 1.4, glucose 130.
Physical exam still remained benign.  Patient was awake and
alert with good cardiac index with the intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:2.  Plan was to change the balloon pump to 1:3 in
the morning and to possibly discontinue the intra-aortic
balloon pump and subsequently wean Neo-Synephrine.  Plan was
also to transfuse one unit for hematocrit of 24.5.

On postoperative day three patient was afebrile, however,
t-max of 101.3 which was at 6:00 o'clock p.m.  Patient was
still on milrinone and Neo-Synephrine with an index of 2.05,
making good urine.  Chest tube was putting out minimal
amount.  White count 14.1, hematocrit 28, platelet count 79.
Sodium 137, potassium 4.5, BUN 53, creatinine 1.7.  Physical
exam remained benign.  Over the last 24 hours patient was in
and out of a-fib and a-flutter throughout the night for which
she was placed on amiodarone.  Currently in atrial
fibrillation at 77 beats per minute.  Cardiology came by to
see patient for atrial fibrillation.  They recommended to
possibly taper off milrinone which may be exacerbating the
situation.  They also recommended oral amiodarone versus IV
amiodarone and to transfuse patient for low hematocrit.

On postoperative day four patient now in normal sinus rhythm,
however, with decreased urine output, on dobutamine at 4.5,
Neo-Synephrine at 1.4, amiodarone and insulin.  Afebrile.
Normal sinus rhythm at 88 beats per minute.  Otherwise vital
signs stable.  White count 14.2, hematocrit 32, platelet
count 117.  Creatinine up from 1.7 to 1.9 with BUN of 55.  On
physical exam patient had decreased breath sounds at both
bases with 1+ edema of the lower extremities.  Patient was
alert with no deficits.

On postoperative day five patient still on dobutamine at 2.5,
insulin, milrinone at 0.5, Neo-Synephrine at 0.25.  Twenty
four events included an episode of pulmonary edema.  Patient
afebrile in normal sinus rhythm at 99 beats per minute.
Vital signs otherwise stable.  White count 14.4, hematocrit
28.1, platelet count 125.  Creatinine increasing from 1.9 to
2.1.  On physical exam lungs had coarse breath sounds
bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.  Patient with adequate
urine output after administering Lasix three times.  Patient
was also noted to be confused, requiring frequent
reorientation.  Heart failure team came by to see patient at
which time they recommended that if blood pressure decreases
or mean arterial pressure decreases to less than 60, they
would add vasopressin.  They also recommended Zaroxolyn 2.5
mg p.o. times one, to start a Lasix drip and can increase up
to 20 mg drip per hour.  If Lasix does not work, to change to
Bumex 2 mg IV b.i.d., increasing up to 4 mg IV b.i.d.  To
also increase milrinone to 0.6 if MAO2 is in the 50s.

Renal came by and saw patient on [**12-16**] at which time
they recommended sending urine sodium, creatinine, urea and
protein to assess pre-renal and ATN parameters.  They also
recommended a renal ultrasound to determine the etiology of
the underlying renal disease.  They also planned to initiate
CVVHD given the significant CHF necessitating 100%
nonrebreather with poor response to diuretics.  They also
said that we could discontinue the Lasix drip.

On postoperative day six patient afebrile in normal sinus
rhythm, alert and awake with increasing white count from 14.4
to 19.4, hematocrit stable at 31.  Creatinine was 2.3.
Physical exam unchanged aside from 2+ pitting edema in all
extremities.  Patient now on CVVH for fluid overload and
renal insufficiency.  On milrinone, amiodarone with cardiac
index of 2.74, now making urine so Lasix was discontinued.
Patient was reintubated on [**12-16**] at the request of the
SSCU staff for respiratory failure.

On postoperative day seven patient still afebrile in normal
sinus rhythm at 94, intubated on SIMV and pressure support
500 and 12 breathing 5 above the vent 80% FIO2 with adequate
urine output.  White count coming down from 19.4 to 14.5 with
stable hematocrit.  Creatinine was 2.2.  Extremities will
less edema.  Otherwise exam unchanged.  Plan is to continue
with CVVH and to continue amiodarone and milrinone.  Renal
came by and saw patient on [**12-17**] at which time they
recommended to continue patient on milrinone to optimize
cardiac function.  To continue CVVH.  They also recommended
to recheck sodium in the afternoon for patient's
hyponatremia.  If still low, to consider changing replacement
fluids to normal saline.  To continue anticoagulation with
heparin 500 units per hour with a goal PTT of 50 to 80.

On postoperative day eight patient with low grade temperature
of 99.9, still intubated with rising white count to 17.5,
stable hematocrit.  Creatinine was 1.8.  On physical exam
patient was intubated and sedated with coarse upper airway
noise and decreased edema in the lower extremities.  Plan was
to begin weaning milrinone.  To continue CVVH.

On postoperative day nine 24 hour events included CVVH being
clotted.  Patient afebrile with cardiac index of 2.2, in
sinus rhythm at 78, good urine output, still intubated and
sedated with minimal lower extremity edema.  Plan was to try
to attempt to wake up patient and to attempt extubation.  To
continue milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and Pitressin.  The heart
failure team came by again at which time they recommended to
continue present pressor support and to check lactate and to
continue CVVHD.  Renal came by and saw patient and restarted
CVVH which was clotted overnight.  Restarted it at 9:00 a.m.
On [**12-19**] patient underwent placement of a right
subclavian Cordis and Swan-Ganz.

On postoperative day 10 patient on vancomycin and levo as
well as vasopressin, Neo-Synephrine, milrinone and insulin.
Afebrile, in sinus rhythm at 65.  Still intubated and
sedated.  On physical exam the left foot appeared more
mottled than normal and cool with a faintly dopplerable DP
pulse and palpable pulse on the right DP.  Plan was to
attempt to wean Pitressin and try to extubate.  Continue
CVVH.  To continue levo for patient's upper respiratory tract
infection, as patient grew out Neisseria in sputum, and
vancomycin for an infected right IJ site.  Extubation was
attempted on the 15th, however, anesthesia was called to
reintubate patient for respiratory failure after extubation
trial.

On postoperative day 11 patient still on vanco and levo as
well as vasopressin, milrinone, insulin, Neo-Synephrine.
Afebrile, in normal sinus rhythm at 82, intubated, on CVVHD
with creatinine of 1.5 and white count of 14.6 and stable
hematocrit of 27.5.  On physical exam the neck was very
erythematous with purulent right IJ site.

On postoperative day 12 still on the same drips.  Twenty four
events included increasing CVVH to 100 per hour.  Patient was
afebrile with stable output and index.  Still intubated with
decreased white blood cell count of 11.7, stable hematocrit
and creatinine of 1.5.  On physical exam left toe was mottled
and cold, otherwise unchanged.

On postoperative day 13, 24 hour events included CVVH being
clotted overnight.  Patient still on the same drips with an
index of 2.0 and CVP of 14.  Still intubated.  Physical exam
remained unchanged.  White count down to 10.7, hematocrit
stable with creatinine of 1.5.  Plan was to continue to watch
hematocrit.  Patient was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells bringing hematocrit up to 27.  Plan was also to
put patient on Nepro tube feeds.  Renal evaluated patient on
[**12-23**] at which time they recommended sending a
urinalysis for patient's hematuria and for patient's
metabolic acidosis which was improved after antibiotics.
They wanted us to follow patient's ABGs and to continue to
transfuse red blood cells, increase intravascular volume with
a goal of 1 to 2 liters negative a day.  That same day a left
femoral central venous Quinton catheter was placed with CVVH
flow now being excellent through this new catheter since
there was a clot in the IJ catheter.  Renal recommended
keeping PTT at 60 to 80, however, closer to 80 to avoid
clotting again.

On postoperative day 14 patient on day six of vanco and levo.
Still on milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, Pitressin, propofol,
still intubated and sedated with a rising white count of
13.3, stable hematocrit of 29.9, creatinine of 1.4.  Physical
exam remained unchanged.  Plan was to continue tube feeds.
Patient was v-paced overnight due to slow junctional rhythm.
Possible discontinuation of patient's amiodarone.  Continue
vanco and levo for Enterobacter and E.coli which grew out of
the cultures.  To continue to watch patient's hematocrit.

On postoperative day 15 patient in normal sinus rhythm,
afebrile, still intubated and sedated with stable white count
and hematocrit.  Slightly hyponatremic at 131 with BUN of 27,
creatinine of 1.3.  Physical exam unchanged.  Plan was to
continue levofloxacin for the URI and the Enterobacter in
blood and sputum.  Renal came by and saw patient at which
time they noted that patient responded to 40 mg IV of Lasix
with a decreased Neo-Synephrine drip today.  They recommended
adding Lasix IV q.d. and b.i.d. and to decrease the amount
removed by CVVH to transition her off CVVH.  They recommended
increasing intravascular volume and keeping hematocrit
greater than 30.

On postoperative day 16 patient with low grade temperature of
99.5, still in sinus rhythm at 78.  Stable white count of
12.1 with hematocrit of 27.  BUN and creatinine stable.
Physical exam unchanged.  On milrinone and Pitressin with
good cardiac index.  Plan was to have a trial off CVVH today
and to increase Lasix to increase patient's urine output.
Plan was also to transfuse one unit of packed red blood cells
and to continue levofloxacin.  Renal again saw patient on
[**12-26**] at which time they recommended to discontinue
heparin and to discontinue CVVH machine.  To administer
patient 40 to 60 mg IV of Lasix b.i.d. to keep patient even
and to continue with blood transfusion.

On postoperative day 17 patient with low grade temperature of
100.6, in sinus rhythm at 79.  Still intubated, opening eyes.
Physical exam remained unchanged.  White count of 13.8,
hematocrit stable at 30.5.  BUN 32, creatinine 1.4.  Still on

temperature of 100.4, in sinus rhythm at 95, index of 3.29.
White count increasing to 15.2 with stable hematocrit of
31.8.  BUN 43, creatinine 1.6.  On milrinone and propofol
now.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  Patient still
intubated and following commands.  Plan was to possibly wean
milrinone and check the mixed venous.  Continue Lasix.
Patient still with good urine output.  Plan was to also pull
the Quinton catheter because of patient's rising white count
and low grade temperature.

On postoperative day 19, day 11 of levofloxacin, with a low
grade temperature of 100.8 and t-max of 102, in sinus rhythm
at 89, now just on insulin and propofol with an index of
2.81.  Still intubated, following commands, in no apparent
distress with a rising white count of 19.7 and stable
hematocrit of 32.4.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  Plan
was to check blood cultures, urine cultures, stool cultures,
chest x-ray and to pull the Swan and the left subclavian line
due to patient's spike in temperature.

On postoperative day 20, day 12 of levofloxacin, with low
grade temperature of 99.7, t-max of 101.3, in sinus rhythm at
99 with rising white count now at 24.4, stable hematocrit

add vancomycin.  Other cultures were pending.

On postoperative day 21, day 13 of levofloxacin and day two
of restarted vancomycin, with t-max of 102, t-current of
99.3, in sinus rhythm at 84.  Still intubated, however, awake
and alert.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  White count
down to 17.7, hematocrit stable.  BUN 68, creatinine rising
at 2.2.  Plan was to try to extubate patient and to continue
Promote tube feeds.  Patient had adequate urine output.  Plan
was to continue to check creatinine.  ID recommended adding
fluconazole.  Thoracic surgery came by to consult patient to
evaluate the airway.  They stated that patient had no
symptomatic edema and they stated that we would perform a
T-piece trial to rest patient overnight with the possibility
of extubating patient in the morning.  The following morning
there was an excellent cuff fit.  Patient went 1 1/2 hours on
T-piece trial yesterday and extubated without problems on
[**2127-1-1**].

On postoperative day 22, day 14 of levofloxacin, day three of
vancomycin, day two of fluconazole, patient with low grade
temperature of 99.5, currently afebrile, in sinus rhythm at
75.  Awake and alert, answering questions.  White count 15.1,
stable hematocrit.  BUN was 79, creatinine 2.1.  Physical
exam remained unchanged.

On postoperative day 23 patient afebrile, in sinus rhythm at
87.  White count down to 13.4, hematocrit stable.  BUN 72,
creatinine 1.7.  Plan was to start patient on p.o. diet and
to possibly discontinue Lasix and to continue current
antibiotic regimen.

On postoperative day 24, day 16 of levofloxacin, day five of
vancomycin, day four of fluconazole, in normal sinus rhythm
at 82, afebrile.  White count 12.8, hematocrit 27.7.  BUN 76,
creatinine 1.7.  Physical exam remained unchanged.  Plan was
to have a Jocelin consult for patient's diabetes management.
Jocelin came by to see patient at which time they recommended
patient to follow up at Jocelin for diabetic care.  Jocelin
had an extensive discussion with patient's husband and
patient.  They arrived at the decision to change to glargine
and Humalog.

On postoperative day 25 patient now on day six of vancomycin,
in sinus rhythm at 93, afebrile with white count of 12.6,
stable hematocrit.  BUN 69, creatinine 1.8.  Resting
comfortably.  Physical exam benign.  Plan was to continue
vancomycin for two weeks.  Jocelin came by to see patient
again at which time they recommended continuing IV insulin
and adjust the rate from now until pre-supper and then before
supper to check blood glucose and to give the sliding scale
of Humalog.  To increase Lantus to 20 units q.h.s.  To use
the new Humalog scale.

On postoperative day 26 patient on vancomycin.
Hemodynamically stable.  Physical exam unchanged.  Patient
now on fluconazole three out of five days.

On postoperative day 27 patient on day seven of 14 of
vancomycin and day four of five of fluconazole.  Patient
afebrile.  Sinus tach at 101.  Physical exam remained benign
with stable hematocrit and stable white count.  Jocelin came
by and saw patient again on [**1-5**] at which time they
recommended to continue Lantus at 25 units q.h.s.  To check
3:00 o'clock finger stick blood glucose.  To be on guard for
lows.  To increase pre-meal Humalog sliding scale and to
watch BUN and creatinine closely with start of ACE inhibitor
post MI.  Hem/onc came by and saw patient on [**1-6**] at
which time they felt that patient's condition was most
consistent with reactive thrombocytosis which may also be due
to iron deficiency, although the rather abrupt onset of the
rise in the platelet count was not consistent with that.
They thought that since these are normal platelets, the risk
of thrombosis is very low and is not a concern until the
platelet count exceeds 1,000,000.  They also felt that one
issue is that in those patients with platelet counts this
high, which is over 400,000, serum potassium level may be
falsely elevated.  Therefore if serum potassium came back
elevated, they would recommend that this be followed up with
plasma potassium before treating.  They said they would
continue to follow patient during her hospitalization.

On postoperative day 28, on day eight of 14 of vancomycin and
day five of five of fluconazole, 24 events included atrial
fibrillation versus atrial tachycardia overnight.  Started on
Lopressor.  With a low grade temperature of 100.  Physical
exam remained unchanged.  White count 12.7, stable
hematocrit.  BUN 40, creatinine 1.3.  Plan was to continue
Lopressor and to consider restarting amiodarone.  To continue
antibiotics.

On postoperative day 29, [**1-8**], anesthesia was called to
see patient to reintubate patient for respiratory distress
and confusion.  Patient was reintubated without
complications.  Pulmonary came by to see patient for the
reintubation at which time they recommended to continue pip,
tazo and vanco, to obtain sputum for gram stain and culture,
to obtain chest CT angio as planned.  To cycle cardiac
enzymes and repeat EKG.  To repeat a surface echo and when
extubated to obtain a speech and swallow evaluation for
aspiration risk.  CT angio of the chest was reviewed.  There
was no clear consolidation.  There was a large pleural
effusion, right greater than left and a tiny PE noted.  The
assessment leaned more toward decompensation and CHF.
Additional recommendations by pulmonary included treating for
CHF and checking daily weights.  A therapeutic thoracentesis
and to send the fluid for pH, LDH, protein, cell count with
diff and culture.

On postoperative day 30, 24 hour events included transfusion
of two units of packed red blood cells.  CT of the chest and
abdomen.  Intubation for CHF.  Panculturing.  Pulmonary and
general surgery consults.  Patient afebrile, in normal sinus
rhythm at 70.  Still intubated, sedated, but arousable.
Physical exam remained unchanged.  White count 17.7, stable
hematocrit 34.1.  Plan was to drain the pleural effusion
today and to try to work toward extubating patient.  GI to do
percutaneous cholecystostomy today and to start tube feeds
once stable.  To follow up BUN and creatinine after dye load.
To continue vanco and Zosyn.  General surgery came by to see
patient on [**1-9**] at which time they stated that they
could not rule out calculus cholecystitis.  They recommended
to drain the gallbladder with a catheter through the liver.
A cholecystostomy tube 8 French was inserted under ultrasound
guidance on [**1-9**] and approximately 60 cc of thin bile
was aspirated.  It was sent for culture and sensitivity.  The
plan was to leave this in for six weeks even if it stopped
draining.  Pulmonary came by to see patient again on [**1-9**] at which time they recommended to decrease FIO2 to 40%.  To
perform thoracentesis of the right sided effusion.  To send
pleural fluid for LDH, protein, cell count and culture.  To
check troponin and CK.

On postoperative day 31, day 11 of 14 of vancomycin and day
three of Zosyn, 24 hour events included percutaneous
cholecystostomy, PICC being removed, bilateral pleural
effusion drainage, right draining 600, left draining 350.
Propofol drip.  White count down to 15.7, stable hematocrit.
BUN 30, creatinine 1.5.  Physical exam remained unchanged.

On postoperative day 32 physical exam remained unchanged.
White count down to 11.5, hematocrit stable.  Creatinine up
to 1.8.  Plan was to restart the standing Lasix, continue
Lopressor and to possibly extubate patient today with the
possibility of trach placement.

On postoperative day 33, day 13 of 14 on vancomycin, day four
of Zosyn, patient with low grade temperature of 99.6, still
intubated, however, comfortable.  Physical exam unchanged.
White count and platelet count and hematocrit unchanged.  BUN
42, creatinine 1.9.  Plan was to possibly perform a trach
tomorrow and to possibly discontinue the chest tubes.  Due to
the rising white blood cell count and low grade temperature,
to possibly panculture patient again.

On postoperative day 34, day 14 of 19 of vancomycin and day
six of Zosyn with a low grade temperature of 100.4.  Plan was
to trach patient today.  On [**1-13**] patient underwent
percutaneous tracheostomy without complications.

On postoperative day 36 patient's condition remained
unchanged.  NPH of 10 b.i.d. was started.  Stable hematocrit
and white count.  BUN 43, creatinine 1.5.  Speech and swallow
came by and saw patient on the 11th at which time they stated
that patient is not a good candidate for a video swallow
study to rule out aspiration because patient presents without
overt signs and symptoms of aspiration at the bedside.
Recommendations were to limit the wear schedule of the
Passy-Muir valve to every four hours for no more than 15
minutes trial.  Monitor O2 sats and patient's respirations.
Maintain tube feeds.  Remain NPO.  Obtain a video swallow
study tomorrow to rule out aspiration.

The remainder of the chart will be dictated upon discharge of
the patient.

Note:  This is an addendum to the discharge summary which was
dictated on [**1-16**], covering [**1-16**] through
[**1-18**], the day of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**1-16**], on postoperative day #37,
which was day 17 of a 19 day course of Vancomycin, the
patient's T-max was 99.3??????, blood pressure 114/44, oxygen
saturation 100%, in sinus rhythm in the 70s.  The patient
remained on CPAP with pressure support at 40%, white count
9.8, hematocrit 30.  The patient was alert.  Heart was
regular, rate and rhythm.  The patient had slightly coarse
breath sounds.  Abdomen was soft.

The patient continued to have trach trials and a swallowing
study to determine where should would be for her
rehabilitation placement.  She continued on Vancomycin as we
awaited a bed.

She was seen again on the 12th by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.  The
[**Hospital **] Clinic did a consult again on [**1-16**] to
reevaluate the Insulin protocol that the patient was using.
They recommended a new protocol for the patient with changing
to Humalog.  They recommended that the patient follow-up with
[**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

The patient was also seen by cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who
noted that she was stable over night, maintaining good blood
pressure and normal sinus rhythm at 80.  Her swallow study
was successful.  The plan was made to continue with her
ventilatory care and continue her beta-blocker, ACE
inhibitor, and await the rehabilitation bed.

On on postoperative day #38, the patient on the trach
ventilator all night.  She did pass her swallowing study.
Her breath sounds continued to clear a bit.  Her incision was
healed.  Her trach site was intact.  She appeared to be doing
well.  She continued on her Plavix and Aspirin, as well as
Lopressor and day 18 of 19 of her Vancomycin.  She also
continued to be covered by the sliding scale Insulin, subcue
Heparin, in addition to her Captopril and her Insulin
protocol [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  They saw her again on the 13th.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
The patient is an 80 year old man with a history of
poliomyelitis as a child, new onset atrial fibrillation, and
recent GI bleed now presenting with respiratory failure. The
patient problems began in late [**Month (only) 956**] when he presented to his
Cardiologist with increased shortness of breath and was found to
be in rapid afib and congestive heart failure. He went for a
cardiac catheterization at the time which showed severe LAD
disease. The cath procedure was complicated by a presumed
reaction to the contrast dye. He was noted to have a bilateral
pneumonia and was started on doxycycline. The patient was
discharged home later afebrile and on warfarin and lasix. He
epresented about a week later to the hospital, febrile and with
hematemesis and BRBPR--his bp was 80/38 with a HR of 125; INR
was 6.2. He was found to have bleeding jejunal diverticulas and
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear--both of which were surgically corrected.
He underwent a head ct for ""sundowning"" which was normal by
report.  He remained intubated, febrile, was started on vanco,
cefepime and flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 80 year old male with recent admit to [**Hospital 108**] hospital
[**2120-3-18**] due to acute dyspnea. He has a new onset A- fib, CHF,
S/P jejunal resection on [**2120-4-5**], for bleeding diverticulae.
Transferred from [**Hospital 108**] hospital for failure to wean from vent.
Since being at [**Hospital1 18**], he has remained intermittantly febrile
(fever curve has improved). He is noted by the nursing staff to
intermittanly follow simple commands, moving all extremities,
and has become agitated at times requiring ativan, fentanyl,
haldol and more recently seroquel. He gets ativan 1 mg tid
standing, fentanyl patch in addition to prn's of those. His
respiratory status has remained tenuous and has been diagnosed
with atypical pneumonia vs. early ARDs. He was transferred to
the surgical service of [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2120-4-12**] for failure to wean
from vent. He was febrile and hypotensive after transfer, and
pressors were started. The pressors were weanted and he was felt
to be in ARDS. He was trached on [**4-17**] and has had generally not
been able to be weaned since that time. He has completed courses
of empiric antibiotics. He has been slowly getting better since
that time, and is being transferred to the MICU service [**2120-5-9**]
for failure to wean from the ventilator.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 80 year old man with a h/o recent onset atrial
fibrillation, GI bleed, and ARDS now presents with continued
respiratory failure. His neurologic exam demonstrates
obtundation--perhaps related to multiple sedating meds. His head
ct shows 2 hypodensities in the right cerebellum that may be
new. The neurologic differential for respiratory insufficency
would include: muscle- critical illness myopathy; NMJ:
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], nerve: AIDP (had reflexes), critical illness
polyneuropathy; cord: high cervical cord injury (does not seem
paraparetic); anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] cell- AlS, west [**Doctor First Name **], enteroviruses
(does have h/o questionable h/o polio). Impression is for a
non-neurologic cause of his respiratory failure (pna, ards). Pt
secondary to His respiratory failure underwent tracheostomy on
[**4-17**]/5.
.
#) Respiratory failure - Patient was trached [**4-17**]. Now
oxygenating and ventilating adequately. Increased secretions but
afebrile, [**3-15**] CXR with improved edema and no PNA. Large amount
of measured dead space contributing to difficulty weaning.
******Continue high fat and low-carb diet to avoid worsening
tachypnea, Pco2*******
Goal is to gradually decrease pressure support 18/5->15/5 as
tolerated on [**5-14**]. Continue nebs prn. Increased cuff pressures
to 35 so tracheostomy tube was changed [**5-14**].
.
#) Hyprenatremia - Patient developed hypernatremia of unclear
etiology. Possibly secondary to Na retention. Continuing TF with
free H20 boluses with good results.
.
#) Encephalopathy and agitation - d/ced standing haldol, use
sparingly PRN. Minimize sedation for now and AVOID BENZOS or
narcotics. Patient mental status clearing, able to follow voice
commands (squeeze hand and wiggle toes).
.
#) Left leg DVT - Holding coumadin on [**5-14**] due to
supratherapeutic INR. No PE on CTA. Restart coumadin once INR<3
for goal of 2.0-3.0 for at least 6 months.
.
#) H/o CHF - Echo EF60%/2+MR/1+TR with PA diastolic
hypertension.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation - supratherapeutic INR initially upon
transfer to MICU. Resumed coumadin [**5-10**] with goal INR 2.0-3.0
for afib. Coumadin was held on [**4-24**] due to upratherapeutic INR.
Resume coumadin when INR<3.0. Continued metoprolol for rate
control.
.
#) FEN - Continued insulin sliding scale. Low-carboohydrate tube
feeds.
.
#) Prophylaxis - Continued prevacid, bowel regimen,
supratherapeutic INR.
.
#) access - d/ced A line [**5-14**], dobhoff
.
#) precautions - for VRE colonization
.
#) code - full, discussed [**5-9**] with wife
.
#) communication - with wife
.
#) PT/OT - seen by PT, encourage OOB to chair and
strength-building
.
#) dispo - to rehab.

Pertinent Results:
[**2182-1-5**] CT: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 2. Below
the left inguinal ligament, tiny hyperdense foci adjacent to the
adductor compartment may represent small residual hematoma, and
are likely related to catheterization in this region. 3.
Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis. 4. Minimal pneumomediastinum and anterior chest
wall subcutaneous emphysema consistent with recent surgery.
[**2182-1-3**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system with patent LMCA. The LAD, LCA and the RCA had
mild plaquing. The Ramus had a 90% ostial lesion. There was a
torally occluded small diagonal branch that filled via
collaterals from the RCA. 2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed normal right and mildy elevated
left sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac output. There
was a 50 mm Hg transortic gradient consistent with severe aortic
stenosis.
PCI of the ramus intermedius.
[**2182-1-3**] CNIS: There is less than 40% right ICA stenosis and less
than 40%left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both vertebral
arteries
[**2182-1-3**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is mild mitral stenosis secondary to the
annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial
effusion.
[**2182-1-3**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal and
there is no pneumothorax. The lungs are clear without
consolidations or effusions. The surrounding soft tissue and
osseous structures demonstrate mild degenerative changes in
thoracic spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32890**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath on [**1-3**] which revealed
severe Aortic Stenosis with one vessel disease. Cardiac surgery
was consulted and he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] pre-operative testing. On [**1-4**] he
was brought to the operating room where he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] an aortic
valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft x 2 and MAZE
procedure. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op
day he continued to have significant amount of post-operative
bleeding and was brought back to the operating room for
re-exploration. Please see separate dictated operative report.
He was then taken back to the CSRU. He remained intubated until
post-op day three secondary to poor oxygenation. He was started
on a Lasix gtt and his chest tubes were removed on post-op day
one/two. His platelet count started to trend down (lowest was
47) and he was tested for HIT. On post-op day three he appeared
to have an expanding abdomen with hypotension and a CT was
performed. CT revealed no retroperitoneal bleed. On post-op day
three he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. HIT panel came back negative. By discharge
his platelets increased to 158. On post-op day five his
epicardial pacing wires were removed, Coumadin was restarted and
he was transferred to the telemetry floor. Since extubation he
did have some confusion and disorientation w/ hallucinations and
Haldol was started. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 32891**] was very decompensated and
physical therapy worked with him for strength and mobility
throughout hospital course. He was ready for discharge to rehab
on POD #7.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
African-American male with a history of severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma (on home oxygen and
steroids) and a history of coronary artery disease who
presented to the Emergency Room on [**3-2**] after being found
by a neighbor in respiratory distress.

The patient remembers being sick with a cold for the week
prior to admission; a cold which was productive of cough,
headache, fatigue, and worsening shortness of breath and
wheezing.  The patient noted he was using his inhalers and
nebulizers more frequently over that time and not gaining
relief of his symptoms.  He denied any palpitations, but he
did not some lightheadedness.  He also recalled some episodes
of chest tightness associated with his shortness of breath
and not associated with exertion.  He noted he tried some
sublingual nitroglycerin tablets which relieved some of the
pain.

On the night prior to admission, the patient again noted an
episode of pain in his chest which was relieved with
nitroglycerin.  He also remembers having significant
respiratory distress, and that is the last thing he
remembers.  He was apparently found by a neighbor calling for
help and was brought into the Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Room, he was noted to be in significant
respiratory distress with an arterial blood gas which showed
a pH of 6.96, a PCO2 of 180, and a PO2 of 112.  The patient
was sedated and intubated.  He was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was then transferred to the Medical
team on [**3-7**] after being extubated for two days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (requiring home
oxygen of 2 liters and chronic steroids at 20 mg p.o. per

in [**Location (un) **] which is an independent living facility for the
homeless people with illnesses.  He has a daughter in
[**Location (un) 686**].  He has a 40-year smoking history of two to three
packs per day.  He quit seven years ago.  No current alcohol
use; although, extensive alcohol in the past which he
discontinued in [**2175**].  He denies any intravenous drug use and
has used marijuana in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed
vital signs with a blood pressure of 125/66, heart rate was
108, temperature was 97, oxygen saturation was 95% on a
ventilator set at 500/14 positive end-expiratory pressure of
5 and 100% of FIO2.   The patient was intubated and sedated.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  They went from 4 mm to 3 mm.  The
oropharynx was moist and pink.  No tongue lacerations.  Neck
revealed no jugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.
Lung examination revealed prolonged expiratory phase with
significant expiratory wheezes (right greater than left), and
coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  The abdomen was firm, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no
edema, but clubbing was present.  Neurologically, the patient
was sedated, grimacing to sternal rub, not responding to
verbal stimuli, and was moving upper extremities
spontaneously.  No reflexes were able to be elicited.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies on admission revealed white blood cell count was 9
(with 38% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes, and 11% monocytes),
hematocrit was 44, and platelets were 113.  Sodium was 141,
potassium was 4.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 33,
blood urea nitrogen was 9, creatinine was 0.8, and blood
glucose was 150.  Creatine kinase was 364, MB was 1.8,
troponin was less than 0.3.  Free calcium was 1.36.  Arterial
blood gas revealed 6.96, with a PCO2 of 180, and a PO2 of
112.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission
was sinus with normal intervals, axis was -90, with
P-pulmonale, and low voltage in precordium.  No ST-T wave
changes.

A chest x-ray showed hyperinflation and ETT about 10 cm above
the carina.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient is a
62-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who comes in with a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation requiring intubation and Intensive Care
Unit stay.

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He was treated with a
ventilator, with nebulizers, and with intravenous steroids.
He received medication for sedation so that he did not fight
the ventilator.

A chest x-ray after several days of admission revealed an
infiltrate, and sputum grew out Moraxella.  The patient was
started on levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. on [**3-5**] and was to
continue for a 10-day course.  The patient had significant
amounts of thick sputum.

The patient was extubated on [**3-6**].  His respiratory
status continued to improve with around the clock nebulizers
and continued inhaler use.  He was put on prednisone 40 mg
and kept there.  Upon discharge, the patient was q.4h. Around
the clock albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers with his inhalers
in between.  The patient was also receiving guaifenesin and
Mucomyst for his sputum.  His pneumonia was being treated
with levofloxacin and was to continue for a total of 10 days.
He has been seen by Respiratory Therapy who recommended a
flutter valve for the patient to help with his secretion
mobilization.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient has a history of
coronary artery disease with a non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction in the past.  He was continued on aspirin and
Lipitor.  His antihypertensive medications were held due to
some hypotension while he was ventilated, and initially
status post extubation.

The patient ended up having a positive creatine kinase with a
troponin leak of 2.  He also had electrocardiogram changes
with his electrocardiogram revealing T wave inversions in the
inferior leads as well as V3 through V6.  These were new
changes.

He was seen by Cardiology, who recommended a dobutamine
stress test when the patient's respiratory status has
improved.  They also recommended continuing full-strength
aspirin of 325 mg, low-dose Lopressor at 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
and continuing Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.

They recommended an echocardiogram, which the patient
received.  This echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction
of greater than 55%.  The left atrium was normal in size.
Normal right ventricular wall thickness.  Left ventricular
cavity size was normal.  Left ventricular wall motion was
normal.  The right ventricular free wall was hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity was markedly dilated.  There was
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The
aortic root was mildly dilated.  Trivial mitral regurgitation
was seen.  There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There was no pericardial effusion.

The patient should follow up in the Cardiology Clinic for a
stress test as an outpatient for evaluation of his coronary
artery disease.

3.  RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient with a stable blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine and good urine output.

4.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient was initially started on
intravenous steroids and changed to prednisone 40 mg p.o.
q.d.  A slow taper should be planned, and the patient is on
chronic doses of 20 mg p.o. q.d.   He was getting
sliding-scale insulin while on the steroids.  He was
continued on his calcium and vitamin D.

5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient with a
metabolic alkalosis; most likely due to volume depletion.  He
received intravenous fluids while nothing by mouth, and his
oral intake improved over his hospital stay.

6.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  On admission, the patient had a
hematocrit of 44, which fell to 32 on [**3-3**]., and dropped
to 29 on [**3-7**].  His hematocrit then improved 37.6
spontaneously on the day prior to discharge.  He had a mean
cell volume of 74.

7.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was found to have
a Moraxella pneumonia.  He was treated with levofloxacin for
a total of a 10-day course.  Blood cultures and urine
cultures have been negative.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of hypertension who presented from an
outside hospital with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction in
the inferior and posterior segments.

The patient had multiple episodes of nausea, chest pressure,
chest discomfort, and epigastric pain over the past two weeks
prior to admission.  Each episode lasted approximately one
hour.  The pain and episodes were stuttering in duration and
progression.  The pain radiated to her back and neck and was
associated with shortness of breath.  The patient also had
shortness of breath at rest.

She presented to an outside hospital where her
electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block
with ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF; ST depressions
in leads I, aVL, V2 through V6.  She was placed on aspirin,
heparin, nitroglycerin, Lopressor, and Integrilin with near
resolution of anginal symptoms.

The patient was then transferred via helicopter to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent catheterization.
An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary
circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular
ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70%
proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left
circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the
origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled
retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic
but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on
electrocardiograms prior to transfer.  The right coronary
artery with initial TIMI-II flow, sequential 90% tubular then
90% ulcerated hazy lesions just before short posterior
descending artery (with 90% ostial) and large posterior left
ventricular branches.  Post Angio-Jet predilation 3 balloon,
Lopressor, and deployment of 3.5 X 33 Hepakote [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 30272**]
posterior descending artery jailed and lost, unable to engage
with base, right coronary artery 0% residual stenosis,
TIMI-III flow.

While transferring the patient to the stretcher status post
catheterization, the patient was given a tablet of Plavix and
became extraordinarily anxious upon attempting to swallow the
pill.  She then raised her heart rate to the 140s.  Her blood
pressure went to 240/130, and the patient went into flash
pulmonary edema.  She was given Lasix 40 mg intravenously
times two and a nitroglycerin 200-mcg bolus followed by a
nitroglycerin drip at 250 mcg/kg per minute.  She was also
Fentanyl 25 mcg for anxiety.  She also reported wheezing
after being given a beta blocker.  At that time, the
patient's blood pressure was at 189/101, and she was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
at the time of admission revealed heart rate was 122, blood
pressure was 189/101, respiratory rate was 20, and the
patient was saturating at 89% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  In
general, an elderly female producing pink frothy sputum,
mildly uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  On neck examination, unable to assess
jugular venous pulsation.  The lungs revealed rales all the
way bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, clicks, or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and radial  pulses were
2+ bilaterally.  No presacral or lower extremity edema.  The
right groin catheterization site was without hematoma or
bruits.  It was clean, dry, and intact.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Moved
all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 119,
bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine
was 1, and blood glucose was 122.  Initial INR was 1.3.
Blood gas revealed 7.37/34/71.  Creatine kinase was [**2118**].

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads
II, III, and aVF with 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1
through V6 (these were dynamic changes).

At [**Hospital1 69**], she had a normal
sinus rhythm with a prolonged P-R interval with normal axis.
Status post catheterization with a left axis deviation, still
with 0.5-mm ST elevations inferiorly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2178-7-2**], the patient was on
aspirin, Lipitor, morphine, heparin, Integrilin, and
nitroglycerin drip.

She was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest
pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.  Her
lung examination was markedly improved on her second hospital
day with crackles halfway up.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**7-2**] which showed an
ejection fraction of 50%.  No aortic stenosis.  Mitral
regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  No
effusions.  The left atrium was mildly dilated with inferior
wall motion abnormalities.

A chest x-ray from early on [**7-3**] showed likely congestive
heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions
(left greater than right), with pulmonary edema.

There was a discussion on [**7-2**] regarding taking the
patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory for treatment
of her left-sided disease.  However, it was decided that at
this time the culprit lesion was indeed the right coronary
artery, and the left-sided lesions would possibly be
corrected at a later date.

On [**7-3**], the patient was placed on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
twice per day and given some as needed medications for her
gas/bloating.  She did have two brief hypotensive episodes to
a systolic blood pressure of 90 which quickly corrected with
250-cc boluses times two.  Her creatine kinases trended down
nicely from 3092 to 2199 to 1456.  Her MB fractions also
trended down from 401 to 221 to 110.

On [**2178-7-4**], the patient was changed from atorvastatin
to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a
mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin
when combined with Plavix.

On [**7-4**], the patient was also started on lisinopril 5 mg
p.o. every day and changed to Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. once per
day.  A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained which
showed the patient fully able to ambulate without becoming
symptomatic.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was informed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] (a
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 47**]) within the next week (telephone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6256**]).
2.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 16071**] answering service was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding our
plans for followup with him at [**Hospital6 3872**]
within the week.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   She was sent home with the support
of her daughter ([**Name (NI) 501**] [**Name (NI) **]) and given handouts on her
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute ST elevation inferoposterior
myocardial infarction. Congestive heart failure, systolic and
diastolic acute on chronic.  Coronary artery disease.
Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day.
2.  Clopidogrel bisulfate 75-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once
per day.
3.  Lansoprazole 30-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day.
4.  Lisinopril 5-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day.
5.  Simethicone 80-mg tablet half to one tablet p.o. four
times per day as needed (for gas).
6.  Metoprolol-XL 25 mg p.o. every day (do not crush).
7.  Fluvastatin 80-mg tablet one tablet p.o. once per day (do
not crush).

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 98584**] developed tachypnea in the ED and his O2 sats
were in the high 80's to low 90's.  He was afebrile and CXR
showed no evidence of consolidation.  He was given lasix and
placed on oxygen.  His sats improved and an abdominal CT was
ordered which showed evidence of cholecystitis.  GI was
consulted and ERCP was performed the same day.  He required 4
units FFP to correct his INR prior to procedure.  There were no
stones in his bile duct and a biliary stent was placed.  He was
trasferred to the ICU for further monitoring due to his troubles
maintaining his O2 saturation.  By hospital day 3, his sats
improved and he was transferred to the floor.  His LFTs trended
down and his symptoms improved.  He was started on a light diet
and will be discharged to [**Hospital 100**] rehab when a bed is available.
INR will be monitored by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been instructed to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10356**] in [**1-15**] weeks. He will also f/u with GI for

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
auto and allogeneic transplant with recurrence on monthly
chemotherapy admitted after he presented for scheduled
chemotherapy with fevers to 101 in clinic and transferred to the
ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy.
.
The patient initially presented to clinic on [**2103-9-27**] for
scheduled Gemzar, navelbine and decadron therapy. He was found
to have a fever to 101. On review of systems at that time the
patient did admit to feeling fatigued and generally unwell
possibly with a component of pleuritic chest pain and dry cough.
CXR at that time revealed an evolving RLL and lingular/LUL
infiltrate. He was admitted for further evaluation with CXR and
CT chest concerning for evolving pneumonia. The patient was
started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and Voriconazole. During his
hospital stay, the patient did have relative hypotension as at
baseline to the range of sbp 90's with tachycardia to the low
100's. The patient did have individual sbp measurements
overnight prior to transfer as low as 80's, reportedly fluid
responsive.
.
The patient was brought to the ICU for elective bronchoscopy.
During the procedure, the patient received 1mg midazolam and a
bolus of 25mcg of fentanyl. Post-procedure the patient was
persistently hypotensive to the range of sbp 78-82 with intact
mentation though some complaints of feeling tired and mildly
lightheaded. His hypotension was refractory to 1L of NS. The
patient was kept in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
.
Of note, the patient has a history of multiple episodes of
pneumonia in the past most recently with fungal pnuemonia based
upon positive galactomannan in [**1-6**].
.
ROS: Denies any recent sick contacts. Notes mild pleuritic chest
pain and nausea. No emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, brbpr,
urinary complaints.

Past Medical History:
Past medical/surgical history:
Hodgkin's disease (see below)
Hypothyroidism
Asthma
s/p biliary stent (see below)
Hepatitis B core+
.
Oncologic history:
1. Diagnosed with stage IIB Hodgkin's lymphoma in 12/99,
completed ABVD for four cycles with the last 1 [**1-31**] cycles
without bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity, followed by
consolidative mantle radiation therapy.
2. Relapsed in [**10-2**] treated with ICE x2 cycles, high-dose
Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization followed by CBV with
autologous stem cell transplant on [**2098-1-23**].
3. Relapsed in [**6-2**] treated with ESHAP x 1 cycle in preparation
for allo stem cell transplant, which he underwent on [**2098-8-7**]
from a sibling related donor with fludarabine and Cytoxan
conditioning. Transplant complicated by liver GVHD confirmed by
a biopsy on [**2099-1-11**] treated with prednisone. Also noted to be
hepatitis B core antibody positive at that time and began on
lamivudine to prevent reactivation.
4. Evidence for recurrent disease and status post a donor
lymphocyte infusion on [**2099-7-2**] with a second one on [**2099-9-9**].
5. Further progression of his disease in [**10-4**] and treated with
ESHAP x 2 cycles on [**2099-10-16**] and [**2099-11-17**].
6. Enrolled on the DC/DLI protocol and received these infusions
in mid [**1-3**] with progressive disease particularly in his lung
base.
7. Outpatient regimen of Rituxan and gemcitabine with
unfortunately progressive symptoms and then followed with two
more cycles of ESHAP in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2100-4-30**] with an
excellent response to therapy.
8. Enrolled on an experimental protocol at the [**Company 2860**] involving
anti-CTLA-4 antibody with donor lymphocyte infusions support
with relatively stable disease.
9. Further progression of his disease over several months with
particularly increasing abdominal involvement and treated with
another cycle of ESHAP in [**4-5**].
10. Treated with CEP chemotherapy on [**2101-6-8**] with a donor
lymphocyte infusion on [**2101-6-29**] at 1 x 108 T cells per kilogram
with marked GVHD of the liver with increased transaminases and
bilirubin requiring CellCept and prednisone with eventual
resolution.
11. Following discontinuation of his immune suppression and no
further GVHD, noted for further progression of his disease, he
was treated with CEP chemotherapy on [**2101-12-19**], [**2102-1-31**], and
[**2102-3-6**] with a response to treatment. Also requiring periodic
thoracenteses of now recurrent pleural effusions.
12. Status post DLI on [**2102-3-29**] at a dose of 1 x 10(8) T cells
per kilogram.
13. Presented in [**6-6**] with increased liver function tests and
bilirubin with infiltration of the pancreatic head with
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. He had a biliary stent
placed. This was changed in [**9-6**].
14. Treated with Day 1,2,3 only of CEP starting on [**2102-6-30**] with
evidence for disease response on CT scan from [**2102-7-21**].
15. Rescanned in [**9-6**] with progression of disease and then
received two more cycles of CEP on [**2102-9-7**] and [**2102-10-10**] with CT
scan on [**2102-11-8**] with response to therapy.
16. Consideration of another DLI, but developed progression of
disease with recurrent hydronephrosis. Treated with another
cycle of CEP on [**2102-11-24**]. D8 held due to low counts. During
this admission, also had thoracentesis for pleural effusions.
17. Planned evaluation for H-DAC inhibitors at [**Company 2860**].

CT Chest:
1. Overall improving patchy ground-glass opacities within the
lungs
bilaterally. Slight increased opacities involving anterior right
upper and
right middle lobes. Findings again suggestive of infection.
2. Unchanged mediastinal mass.
3. Slight decrease in size of right lower lobe mass.
4. Slight decrease in size of incompletely evaluated
retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
5. Tiny perihepatic ascites.

CT Abd:
1. Overall, stable retroperitoneal disease burden.
2. Slight improvement in some regions of consolidation within
the lungs,
although there is increased ground-glass opacity seen in the
upper lobe of
both the right and left lungs. This may be secondary in part to
regions of
improving aeration when compared to prior consolidation,
although some regions which appear to have worsening
ground-glass opacity may be secondary to atypical infection
including processes such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] other
infectious/inflammatory processes.
3. Unchanged appearance of mediastinal masses.
4. Multiple hypodense foci seen within the spleen and liver.
These
presumably may be secondary to Hodgkin involvement, and while
somewhat more prominent than on prior examination, they do not
appear to be new.
5. Moderately severe narrowing of the splenic vein, without
total occlusion at this time. In addition, there is
moderate-to-severe narrowing of the mid portal vein as well.

PATHOLOGY

Sigmoid colon biopsy:
1.  Diffuse regeneration of the crypts, consistent with a
healing process (see note).
2.  No viral inclusions, granulomas or tumor seen.
3.  Immunostain is negative for CMV with satisfactory control.

Renal biopsy, needle: Consistent with ""acute tubular necrosis"",
see note.

Bone marrow and core biopsy:
1.  Markedly hypocellular marrow with left-shifted myelopoiesis,
dysmegakaryopoesis, and mild eosinophilia, see note.
2.  No Hodgkin lymphoma seen.
Note: Overall the findings are suggestive of acute marrow injury
from secondary causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic,
immune insult etc.  Please correlate with clinical and other
laboratory, including cytogenetic findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 45-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's disease
status post multiple disease relapses after auto and allo SCT,
most recently treated with Gemzar, Navelbine and Decadron on 30
day cycle, who presented with fever to 101 prior to chemotherapy
administration.
.
## Fever/Pneumonia: CT findings suggested pneumonia as source of
fevers. He was initally treated with levoquin, but this was
changed to vancomycin cefepime/voriconizole for broader
coverage. Beacause of concern for sepsis, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for bronchoscopy which revealed thick white
secretions c/w pna. Small blood in one of BAL samples was likely
due to trauma. Following bronchoscopy, the patient's SBP dropped
to 60s with Versed so got 500 cc bolus with improvement to
80s-90s. Post bronchoscopy CXR showed slight worsening of RLL
infiltrate. Sputum cultures were negative.  Pt was started in
extended course of Abx.  The patient had a repeat bronchoscopy
on [**10-8**], with BAL cultures showing just oropharyngial flora and
no PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] remained afebrile off antibiotics prior to
discharge.
Pt continued home salmeterol and albuterol for asthma
.
## Hypotension: Pt was noted to be hypotensive during his
admission.  He had a history of chronic steroid use which had
been discontinued. It was felt that his hypotension was possibly
due to adrenal insufficiency and he was restarted on stress dose
steroids with marked improvement in hemodynamic response. Pt
became nauseated and did not take prednisone or other oral meds
and was noted to have additional episodes of hypotension
[**Date range (1) 3923**].
He was switched to PO prednisone on [**10-27**] and was discharged on
prednisone 10 mg daily.
- Consider tapering off prednisone as an outpatient.
.
## Diarrhea: [**10-9**], pt reported having several loose stools.  He
was started on flagyl with concern for c. difficile.  GI was
consulted and the patient was subsequently started on PO
vancomycin, however c. dif testing was negative x 3.  Flex sig
was recommended done on [**10-13**] showing normal mucosa in the
sigmoid colon (biopsied).
.
## Acute Renal Failure:  On [**10-7**], pt was noted to have a non-gap
metabolic acidosis with a creatinine of 1.5.  He was started on
IV fluids with bicarb, however renal function progressively
worsened despite hydration.  Renal service was consulted.  A
vanco level was 57. Potentially nephrotoxic medications were
held, (including acyclovir).  Dialysis was initiated on [**10-12**].
Renal biopsy done on [**10-18**] c/w ATN.  He continued on dialysis
until [**10-24**] and his HD line was removed on [**10-29**].  Creatinine was
stable around 3.4 off dialysis.
- Follow electrolytes
- Outpatient renal f/u scheduled.
.
## Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient had a history of multiple
relapses. He was scheduled to receive Gemzar, Navelbine and
Decadron. Treatment was initially on hold given possible
infectious issues.  However, there was concern that renal
failure, diarrhea and rising LDH may be related, however renal
and GI biopsies were not consistent with lymphoma.
.
# Hypotension. Hemodynamically stable; thought to be due to
adrenal insufficiency. Pt was on hydrocortisone but switched to
Prednisone.  Was stable but had additional hypotension on [**10-8**] so
was restated on high dose steroids- now on 10 mg
methylprednisolone daily.
.
# HBV core Ab positive. Continue lamivudine therapy.  Dosing was
adjusted for CrCl.
- Readjust dose per renal function.
.
# FEN: Regular diet.  [**10-19**] TPN initiated due to poor PO intake.
Stopped [**10-22**].
.
# Access: L portocath
.
# Contact: HCP, [**Name (NI) 3924**] [**Name (NI) 3925**], father of patient,

History of Present Illness:
83 yo female with h/o breast CA s/p mastectomy and chemo and h/o
syncope vs seizure event in [**2108**] who is transferred with a left
cerebellar ICH.

She was feeling fine the morning of presentation and got into a
shower.  She then felt LH and increased the hot water. She still
felt LH, leaned forward to grab something and her ""head swam""
and she felt strange. She then went down to her knees and
realized she was going to faint. She reports hitting her
shoulder, but she does not think she hit her head(she is not
sure though).  She was apparently in the tub for some time
unable to get up(possibly hours) before her son found her and
called EMS. She went to [**Location (un) 620**] and had a head CT which showed a
left cerebellar hemisphere hemorrhage with some edema, but no
obstruction of the 4th ventricle. She was given mannitol 25g and
transferred here.

She has been mildly confused; per her son, this started about 3
weeks prior to presentation, fairly acutely. For example, she
has been calling the cat the wrong name, went out on the balcony
not fully dressed, and thought it was the fourth of [**Month (only) 205**] last
week. She is usually fully functional at home, living just with
her cat, so this was a significant change from her baseline.

She also has a positive troponin, but had no CP or ECG changes
and no ASA was given due to the hemorrhage.

ROS: Patient denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
headache, dysarthria, dysphagia, neck pain, weakness, numbness,
tingling, visual changes, diplopia, hearing changes, chest pain,
shortness of breath, or bowel/bladder problems.

Past Medical History:
-Breast CA s/p mastectomy and chemo.  Right mastectomy 6 yrs
ago,
followed by chemo and tamoxifen.  She had recurrence in LNs and
was treated with 16 months chemo ~1 yr ago.  She was off for
several months, then got new LNs, so started XRT and got 37
treatments which finished 6 weeks ago.  She also gets frequent
PRBCs.  Onc is Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6099**] at N-W (part of Farber)

Imaging:
HCT [**5-7**]: 1. Small hyperdense focus in the left cerebellum
likely represents subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mild surrounding
edema, but no significant mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease, with additional area
of hypodensity in the right parietal lobe that may represent an
area of subacute infarction. If there is clinical concern, MRI
would be more sensitive for evaluation of acute brain ischemia.

MRI [**5-8**]: Multiple infarcts involving several vascular
territories, the largest area involving the right temporal and
parietal regions, which appear acute and subacute. The areas of
enhancement could certainly represent some of the more acute
foci of infarction. Blood products in both the right parietal
region as well as the left cerebellum.
These multiple findings can be unified with the diagnosis of
emboli. Please consider a cardiac echo to evaluate for thrombus
and defects such as a PFO or ASD. Follow up examination in a few
days may help to differentiate multiple emboli from the
possibility of metastatic disease given the patient's history of
breast cancer.

C-spine x-ray: 1. Limited study as described above. The cervical
spine cannot be fully evaluated on these views; however, there
are no signs for acute injury. If there is high clinical
concern, cross-sectional imaging with CT scan can be performed.
2. Extensive degenerative change of the cervical spine. There is
also retrolisthesis of C3 over C4 and anterolisthesis of C4 over
C5.

CTA Head & Neck w/Contrast: 1. 3mm left supraclinoid internal
carotid artery aneurysm.  2. Fusiform aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm
in the V3 segment of the right vertebral artery.  3. Right upper
lobe peripheral consolidation could represent areas of
infection/neoplasm or pulmonary infarct from emboli.

Chest CT w/Contrast: 1. Air bronchogram containing right upper
lobe opacity is likely infectious with malignant etiologies
including a slow growing bronchoalveolar carcinoma felt less
likely. Slightly prominent peripheral interstitial markings more
inferiorly is also likely infectious however underlying
lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded. Recommend
appropriate treatment and repeat CT examination in three months
to assess for change.
2. Small pericardial effusion. Small right renal hypoattenuating
lesion, likley benign but too small to characterize.
3. Moderate hiatal hernia.
4. Moderate atherosclerotic vascular disease.

TEE [**2111-5-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at
rest x 2 (unable to cooperate with maneuvers). There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta.  Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 yo female with h/o breast CA s/p mastectomy and
chemo and history of syncope vs seizure event in [**2108**], confusion
x 3 weeks, who is transferred with a left cerebellar ICH. On
MRI, found to have multiple infarcts, likely embolic as there is
a large right temporoparietal infarct and multiple other small
infarcts in anterior and posterior circulations bilaterally.
.
1. Neurology: Initial and repeat head CT stable.  MRI showed
right temporoparietal infarct, several other small right and
left infarcts, c/w embolic source or prothrombotic state.  It
was felt that she was prothrombotic and hypercoaguable due to
her malignancy.  We did not start anticoagulation because of the
presence of a large hemorrhagic transformation in the
cerebellum.  Started ASA 325.  Lipid panel was total 163/HDL
46/triglycerides 99/LDL 90, increased Pravastatin to 40.
Hemoglobin A1C was 4.7.  Plan to Repeat MRI with contrast in one
month and follow-up in [**Hospital 4038**] clinic at that time to readdress
starting anti-coagulation such as Lovenox.  Plan discussed with
patient and son who understand the risks of bleeding on
anti-coagulation soon after the stroke and of subsequent strokes
from prothrombotic state due to her underlying metastatic breast
cancer.

2. She had a right upper lobe peripheral consolidation seen on
CXR, which could represent areas of infection/neoplasm or
pulmonary infarct from emboli.  She will need follow up CXR or
CT scan, as an outpatient to further assess the nature of this
finding.  Her PCP was notified.

3. Status post fall:  CT c-spine done at [**Hospital3 4527**]
Hospital, report no fracture but positive for retrolisthesis.
MRI C-spine without ligamentous injury.
.
4. Cards:  Monitored on telemetry without events.  Patient had
elevated tropT (peak 0.20) with normal MB index.  TTE with
normal EF, agitated saline contrast study revealed late bubbles
which may reflect pulmonary A-V shunting but cannot exclude
intracardiac shunt.  TEE negative for valvular vegetations,
clot, large atheromas or ASD/PFO.  TSH and LFTs normal
.
5. ID:  CT chest performed showed air bronchogram containing
right upper lobe opacity, likely infectious with malignant
etiologies including a slow growing bronchoalveolar carcinoma
felt less likely.  Slightly prominent peripheral interstitial
markings more inferiorly is also likely infectious however
underlying lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
Recommend appropriate treatment and repeat CT examination in
three months to assess for change.  Started on Cipro for
treatment of community acquired pneumonia for 7 day course.
.
6. GU:  Continued her home Detrol.
.
7. Heme:  Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.  Per her son, she has been intermittently anemia since
start chemotherapy and has required blood transfusions in the
past. She drifted down to a nadir of 22.5 and was transfused two
units of packed red cells on [**2111-5-12**] with an appropriate bump in
her hct to 30.9.  She will need intermittent checks of her hct
and should be tranfused for hct<25.  Her stools were guaiac'd
and were negative.
.
8. PPx:  PPI, RISS, Tylenol
.
9. Other:  PT/OT evaluated patient and recommended discharge to
rehab.

Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Hospital 108**] Hospital w/ AMI s/p CABG, Resp failure
s/p Trach, CVA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bilateral thoracenteses

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o M with PMHx significant for Hyperchol, HTN developed
sudden onset nausea, diaphoresis, presyncope on [**2153-12-7**] while
in [**Last Name (un) 3625**] land. He was then taken to a local hospital in [**State 108**]
where he was found to have acute STEMI. He was then transferred
to [**Hospital 108**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 6185**] where he had a cath which showed
totally occluded left main, dz in R post descending and
stenoisis of proximal LAD. He immediately underwent an emergent
CABG and had 6 grafts placed. On [**2153-12-9**], he was extubated.
Soon after his extubation, he went into PEA. He then had a ?
embolic stroke with right sided hemiplegia with CT brain showing
hypodensity in Left parietal region, L external capsule region.
During his postoperative period, he developed HIT (started on
Bivalirudin) and AFib (started on Amiodarone drip). He was then
trached on [**2153-12-18**] and started on Dialysis on [**2153-12-21**] for
renal failure. During his OSH course, he developed low grade
fevers between 100-101 with all workup being negative including
Blood Cx, Urine Cx, Sputum Cx, CT chest/abd/pelvis although his
chest xray did show LLL consolidation. HE was emperically
started on Meropenem, Linezolid, Diflucan and his white count
started coming down and was afebrile for 24 hrs before transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as was wished by his
family with the plan to eventually transition him to a rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 M w/ HTN, Hyperchol p/w STEMI s/p CABG, CVA, Resp failure s/p
trach, AFib, HIT, ARF on HD
.
1) Cardiac:
a) Coronaries: Patient is s/p STEMI with emergent CABG performed
at [**Hospital 108**] hospital, 6-vessel bypass.
- BB (will try maximal blockade), ASA
- Started low-dose AceI once Cr =1.5 (in the setting of
resolving ATN)
- Lipitor initially started for modification of hyperlipidemia.
Patient had elevated CPK status-post lipitor. CK trending down
with discontinuation. Statin held for now; will need to be
re-addressed as outpatient.
.
b) Rhythm: h/o Afib during recent hospitalization.
- CHADS2 score undetermined (1 point definitely for HTN only;
unable to determine if patient has long-term CHF as cardiac
remodeling still in progress, no prior h/o DM, and cannot
determine definitively if embolic CVA related to CVA)
- Argatroban for anti-coagulation; have now bridged to coumadin
for goal INR [**2-2**]
- Initially on Amio gtt for rate/rhythm control -> tapered with
Amiodarone HCl 300 mg PO BID Duration x 7 Days (end date [**12-29**]);
then Amiodarone 300 mg daily
.
c) PUMP:
- ECHO: EF of 25% initially s/p MI on [**12-10**] at OSH
- Repeat TTE on [**12-25**] shows depressed LVEF, but unable to
quantify because of limited echo windows
- ACEI, BB
- diuretics PRN
.
2) Resp failure: was intially on IMV, switched to CPAP/PS, now
s/p trach and s/p extubation. Respiratory status was further
compromised by bilateral pleural effusions. Pt currently able to
breath with trach mask for 20-24 hours at a time but becomes
subjectively dyspneic and requests CPAP/PS for 2-4 hours after
that; this should continue to improve.
-PE unlikely, LENI's were negative, although upper ext USG
showed chronic RIJ DVT, superficial left cephalic vein thromosis

- diuresed PRN for pulm edema; however, patient auto-diuresed
with resolving ATN
- thoracenteses performed under ultrasound guidance on [**12-26**] &
[**12-28**] for large pleural effusions
.
3) Fevers: of unknown source, white count trending down
(compared to OSH). Consider nosocomial pneumonia vs. drug fever.

- Patient managed initially on Meropenem and Linezolid but
changed to Cefepime and Linezolid for VAP and good response to
fever; sputum cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) 8974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] plan for nafcillin through
[**2154-1-6**].
.
4) Stroke: Presumed embolic event, consider in the differential
DVT vs. hypokinetic cardiac thrombus s/p MI vs. PFO. Afib seems
unlikely to be the cause as the temporal relationship does not
correspond, although again this cannot be determined. Patient
with residual right side hemiplegia which correlates with
infarction of left parietal region and left external capsule
region.
- ASA; argatroban transitioning to coumadin
- Per neurology consult: recommended TTE to evaluate for PFO.
Bedside TTE [**12-23**] inadequate secondary to poor patient windows.
No bubble study performed. Patient sent for nuclear right
vetriculogram to eval for EF but again, study inadequate. Per
cardiology - although unable to see PFO - treatment would be
lifelong ASA therapy. Because patient had massive MI, he will
already be on chronic ASA therapy and finding of PFO would not
change treatment.
- bilateral UE ultrasounds: no signs of clot.
.
5) Acute Renal Failure: likely due to ATN in the setting of
hypovolemic shock
- Initially managed at OSH with HD but this measure was
discontinued after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] with resolution of ARF. HD
catheter pulled [**12-26**], tip sent for culture.
- On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient initially managed with Diuril and
IV Lasix with good response. Afterward, patient autodiuresing
well.
- renally dose meds; now corrected for improving renal function

- ACEI restarted once Cr =1.5.
.
6) Anemia: baseline HCT unknown, HCT stable compared to OSH
- transfuse for HCT <28 in the setting of recent MI and CHF
- EPO
- Hemodynamically stable
.
7) Thrombocytopenia: unclear baseline plt count; however,
downward trending from 400+ on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] to 221.
Consider Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.
- h/o HIT per OSH
- Confirmed that patient received no heparin flushes; documented
in allergy list
.
8) Hyperglycemia: patient does not carry a diagnosis of DM, now
with persistent hyperglycemia and requirement of ~60 units/day
of insulin. Initially was managed with insulin gtt; now
transitioned to NPH 25 units qAM, 10 units qHS, plus SSI for
coverage.
.
9) PPX: protonix, HOB elevation, pneumoboots. Regarding need for
anti-coagulation, patient has multiple indications, including
Afib (Chads2 score undeterminable), embolic CVA, deep vein
thrombus, HIT. Duration of anticoagulation therapy for each of
these comorbidities varies; will bridge to coumadin therapy now
with Argatroban, with plan to determine duration of therapy in
discussion with Cardiology as outpatient.
.
10) FEN: Started on tube feeds for nutritional support. S&S
study on [**12-28**] revealed patient able to tolerate pureed solids
and thin liquids. PO intake very slow at first and patient
unable to meet caloric requirements; tube feeds continued while
advancing diet. Replete electrolytes to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
- Aspiration precautions
- If pt able to continue advancing diet over next week or two,
would favor tapering tube feedings and resuming normal diet. If
not able to maintain caloric intake, will need PEG, but pt
appears able to tolerate increasing po diet for now, so
hopefully will avoid PEG with Dobhoff for now.
.
11) Access: PICC (repositioned [**12-26**]), Dialysis catheter
(discontinued [**12-26**]), Aline (discontinued [**12-23**])
.
12) Code Status: Full

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
Russian speaking male with a past medical history significant
for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2143**], status post percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stent to the LAD and left circumflex
in [**2152-10-21**] in [**Location (un) **] who presents with worsening
and more frequent episodes of chest pain.

The patient notes daily angina at rest, as well as when
exerting himself which is substernal in location without
radiation.  There was no associated nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  Prior to the day of
admission, the daily chest pain was responsive to 3 to 10
sublingual nitroglycerin per day, but over the last 24 hours
his chest pain has been refractory to nitroglycerin and so he
decided to come in.  Of note, the patient was seen by his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15490**], in clinic
approximately one weeks prior to admission where the increase
in his angina had been noted.  There was a plan for an
outpatient ETT and possible catheter pending those results.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  There were no fevers or chills, nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea.  The patient denied any abdominal pain.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was afebrile and had
stable vital signs.  His electrocardiogram showed no acute
changes.  His chest pain was not responsive to three
sublingual nitroglycerin, but it completely resolved with 2
mg of morphine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient has had multiple
cardiac catheterizations with the most recent one being done
in [**Location (un) **] in [**2152-10-21**] at which time a stent was
placed in the LAD and left circumflex.  His most recent
catheter done at [**Hospital6 256**] prior
to this admission was in [**2151-4-22**].  That catheter showed
a 20% lesion in the left main, 50% in the LAD, 50% in the
left circumflex, previously placed stent which was deemed to
be hemodynamically insignificant and a 75% right coronal
artery lesion.  Most recent stress MIBI done in [**2151-4-22**]
showed ischemia in the inferolateral region.
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy
3.  Hypertension
4.  Hypercholesterolemia
5.  History of pancreatitis during his admission in [**Location (un) **]
for his cardiac catheterization
6.  Status post pacer placement in [**2148-12-22**] for sick
sinus syndrome which was upgraded in [**2152-12-22**] for
lead upgrades and generator change.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day
2.  Lipitor 40 mg po q day
3.  Prevacid 30 mg po q day
4.  Prinivil 5 mg po q day
5.  Toprol XL 25 mg po q day

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is originally from [**Country 532**].  He
has lived in the United States for approximately six years.
He speaks limited English.  He drinks occasional alcohol.  He
denies tobacco.  He is married.  He has one son who lives
nearby as well as a daughter who is a nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) **].

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  Blood pressure
117/78, heart rate of 52, respiratory rate 18, saturating
97%.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert and oriented x3 in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  There was
no jugular venous distention.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  There was no
hepatosplenomegaly.  There were normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The PT
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count of 7.2, hematocrit of 47.3, MCV
of 88, platelets of 173, PT of 12.4, INR 1.1, PTT of 25.
Sodium of 144, potassium of 4.0, chloride of 110, bicarbonate
of 24, BUN of 19, creatinine of 1.0, glucose of 113, CK of
130, MB of 3, troponin less than 0.3.  Electrocardiogram -
most recent cholesterol in [**2153-4-21**] showed total
cholesterol of 169, LDL of 102, HDL of 48.  Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm at 51 beats per minute with normal
axis and normal intervals, except for slight prolongation of
the QRS at 124 milliseconds.  There were no acute ST or T
wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 75-year-old
male with significant coronary artery disease who is admitted
for worsening chest pain.  There was concern for possible in
stent restenosis given the patient's recent cardiac
catheterization in [**2152-10-21**].  The patient was
admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was admitted as already
stated and his cardiac enzymes were cycled.  Over the first
24 hours, the patient's CKs remained flat at 130 to 125 to
156, however the MB fraction went from3 to 6 to 9.
Initially, it was unclear whether the patient did have
unstable angina or not given that his enzymes were not
positive and his initial troponin was less than 0.3 despite
over one day of chest pain at home unresponsive to
nitroglycerin.  In addition, there was a confounding lab
discovery of acute pancreatitis and it was felt that this may
explain the patient's pain as well.  A repeat troponin on the
second hospital day came back positive at 4.4.  At that time,
cardiology was consulted for cardiac catheterization given
the fact that the evidence was now showing the patient was
having unstable angina.

Cardiology saw the patient in the morning and recommended
that the patient undergo cardiac catheterization that same
day.  However, the patient refused this procedure and wanted
to wait.  The urgency was stressed with the patient, but he
still refused the procedure.  He was started on an Integrilin
drip, as well as nitroglycerin and heparin drip.  He was
continued on his beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.  The hope
was that his family could convince him to undergo cardiac
catheterization and the medications would help protect
against further cardiac damage.  The patient was chest pain
free with the above interventions, however his platelets
dropped after being on the Integrilin drip for 24 hours and
therefore the Integrilin had to be discontinued.

The importance of cardiac catheterization was again stressed
with the patient and his daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] and he
finally agreed to go to cardiac catheterization.  He was
scheduled to on Monday morning, the fourth hospital day and
he was stable until Monday morning.  However, prior to being
transported for catheter, he then developed severe [**8-30**]
substernal chest pain and was rushed to catheterization
emergently.  At catheterization, he was found to have 100%
restenosis of his LAD stent, as well as 99% occlusion of the
tube.

He also had 40% proximal in stent stenosis in the left
circumflex artery as well as 50% distal occlusion in the left
circumflex.  He also had 70% calcified mid RCA lesion at 60%,
posterolateral RCA lesion.  The LAD was restented with good
results.  However, the patient did suffer an acute anterior
myocardial infarction prior to catheterization with his CK
peaking at 1334.  His electrocardiogram evolved with eventual
development of Qs in leads V2 through V6.

After cardiac catheterization, the patient was scheduled to
return to the general medical floor, but suffered recurrent
chest pain in the recovery suite.  Therefore, he was rushed
back into catheter for a re-look.  There were no significant
changes during the re-look procedure and no additional
interventions were made.  The patient was then transferred to
the CCU for closer monitoring given his unstable nature and
large anterior myocardial infarction.

The patient initially did well after his cardiac
catheterization, however did have intermittent chest pain
with no electrocardiogram changes.  However, two days after
cardiac catheterization the patient was found to be
unresponsive to voice, tactile or noxious stimuli.  An
emergent head CT was performed (an MRI could not be performed
given the patient's pacemaker as well as recent stent
placement) and it showed no evidence of a bleed, but possible
new stroke in the thalamic region.

From a cardiac standpoint, the patient has been stable
following his catheterization.  His blood pressure
medications were held for a period given his acute stroke,
but has since been restarted at low doses.  His blood
pressure goal at this point is around a systolic of 120.  He
had an echocardiogram performed after his cardiac
catheterization and acute myocardial infarction and his
ejection fraction was found to be down to only 25%.  There
was severe depression of overall left ventricular systolic
function.  There was severe global hypokinesis with some
preservation of the basal wall motion.  This was new compared
with prior echocardiogram.  There was no evidence of left
ventricular thrombus.

Given the patient's new depressed ejection fraction, he was
started on a low dose of Lasix to prevent congestive heart
failure.  He was on 20 mg po q day.  However, on the day of
this discharge summary this has been held as the patient
appears to be getting too dry with this dose.  He likely will
need to be on a lesser dose, possibly 20 mg po q o day.

The patient is on Plavix 75 mg for one month given his stent
placement.  He is also to continue on aspirin 325 mg q day.

2.  NEUROLOGIC:  As already stated, the patient suffered an
acute stroke on [**2153-5-2**].  The stroke was felt to be
most likely embolic in origin possibly from plaque that had
been dislodged during the cardiac catheterization.
Neurologic exam immediately after the event showed the
patient to have no eye opening.  He was spontaneously
breathing with a normal pattern.  There was no blink to
threat.  The right pupil was 6 mm and fixed.  The left pupils
was 1 mm and could not be assessed for reactivity given how
small it was.  There was sluggish response to the doll's
maneuver, but the patient was able to cross midline
bilaterally.  There was no facial asymmetry to grimace.  The
patient withdrew both arms to nail bed pressure and lifted
them off the bed briefly with at least antigravity power to
the deltoids.  He withdrew his left leg and pulled his heel
back all the way to the buttocks.  His right leg was
externally rotated and withdrew a few inches.  His plantar
responses were noted to be flexor initially.

As already stated, his blood pressure was initially run
higher or attempted to be run higher at greater than 140 by
holding his blood pressure medications.  Despite holding his
blood pressure medications however, his blood pressure was
never above the 120 to 130 range.  He was started on
Coumadin, both given his low ejection fraction as well as to
help prevent against future cerebral events.  He was
continued on heparin as a bridge.  His exam was followed
closely.

At the time of this discharge summary, the patient has
improved in regards to his neurologic status.  Most recent
neurologic exam performed with an interpreter shows the
patient to be somnolent, but arousable to loud stimuli.  He
will open his eyes intermittently on the left.  He follows
some simple commands such as sticking out his tongue or
showing two fingers or wiggling his toes.  He can answer
simple questions.  However, his speech was noted to be
severely dysarthric.  He is noted to have a left hemiparesis,
including face, arms and legs.  He also has frontal release
signs consistent with possible underlying dementia.

At the time of this discharge summary, we are repeating a
head CT to evaluate extent of the stroke and we are starting
low dose methylphenidate at 5 mg to see if this will help
with the patient's attention and arousability.  The neurology
team feels that the patient has a good prognosis given his
degree of recovery in only a few days.  At the time of this
discharge summary, the patient's blood pressure has been
allowed to be lower, given that it has been approximately one
week since the event.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have developed a
pneumonia during the time of his stroke.  It was felt to be
likely secondary to aspiration.  He was started on Levaquin
and Flagyl and on [**5-10**] he was on day 9 of 14.  He is
still having thick secretions, but is improving overall.  He
is requiring only 2 liters of oxygen at this point and has
been on room air during the day saturating 95% requiring
oxygen only at night.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  An nasogastric tube was placed for
tube feeds, given that the patient was not able to feed
himself.  Gastrointestinal was consulted for possible PEG
placement given that this will likely be a long term need for
the patient.  They did not feel comfortable placing a PEG
given that the patient cannot be taken off Plavix for 30 days
given his high risk for restenosis.  A pediatric nasogastric
tube was placed on [**5-9**] in interventional radiology.
The issue with the nasogastric tube is that the patient
continues to grab at it when his hands are unrestrained.  At
the time of this discharge summary, we are going to attempt
mittens to see if this will prevent the patient from pulling
out the tube.

In addition, we will see if interventional radiology would be
willing to put in the PEG despite having Plavix on board.  If
there was no way to place a PEG, then this would have to be
done when his course of Plavix is finished.

5.  HEME:  The patient had [**Last Name **] problem in regards to his
hematocrit.  His platelets, which had dropped when he was on
the 2B3A have recovered.  His most recent hematocrit was 41.9
with most platelets of 246.  His Coumadin is currently being
held given the possibility of invasive procedures.  He is
being heparinized.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient is on
ProMod with fiber at 75 cc an hour with 200 cc free water
boluses 4x daily.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair

ADDENDUM:

1.  Genitourinary:  On the day prior to discharge, the
patient developed hematuria and passage of clots without a
Foley catheter in place.  His PTT at the time was 87 (goal
was 60 to 100).  A three-way Foley catheter was placed with
one liter of urine immediately draining.  Urology saw the
patient.

The patient has a questionable history of a bladder mass
which was resected in [**2142**] (noted in an Operative Note but no
pathology specimens available), by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2143**].  He
also had a transurethral resection of the prostate at that
time.  He also has a history of bladder calculi (uric acid)
and hematuria in [**2147**] with negative cytology at that time.

Urology irrigated the bladder and there were no further clots
present.  He was not placed on continuous irrigation.  He was
noted to have one liter of urine in the bladder so is likely
retaining urine, (although last void is not known as the
patient is incontinent).  The hematuria is likely due to
either previous irritation of Foley catheter, recurrent
stones, or recurrent tumor.  Urology recommends outpatient
abdominal/pelvic CT scan and cystoscopy when the patient is
stable from a neurologic/cardiac standpoint.

He should keep the Foley catheter in place for at least one
week (given the question of retention), with then close
monitoring of urine output and post-void residuals.  A
heparin sliding scale was adjusted to a goal PTT of 60 to 80.
His hematocrit has remained stable despite the bleeding.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has been found to have
occult blood positive stools.  He had polyps removed in [**2150**]
and his primary care physician had planned on scheduling an
outpatient colonoscopy this year.  He can have this done when
he is stabilized from a neurologic/cardiac standpoint.

He will continue with the pediatric NG tube until his Plavix
can be discontinued on [**2153-5-30**], and he will have a PEG
placed at that time if he is still not taking anything by
mouth.  He appears to be tolerating the pediatric NG tube at
this time.

3.  Neurologic:  His repeat head CT scan done on [**2153-5-10**], showed bilateral thalamic foci with new attenuation
lesions in the right occipital lobe.  The old right thalamic
lesion is slightly larger than in the previous CT scan.
Neurology feels this is evolution of his previous stroke.
There has been no new events.  He will continue with
neurologic rehabilitation as well as aspirin, Coumadin for
secondary prevention.  He will continue on Ritalin at 5 mg
p.o. q. day.  He will follow-up with Neurology after his
discharge from rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Same as in original summary with the
following exceptions.
1.  Restart aspirin now on the day of discharge as he is not
going to have any further invasive procedures.
2.  Restart Coumadin in one to two days if this hematuria
stabilizes with the goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

SOB was improved s/p cardioversion and he was discharged in
stable condition in sinus rhythm and without complaints.
.
Pt was recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2111-12-7**]. Pt was
feeling unwell, and electrocardiogram showed underlying atrial
fibrillation in a fully ventricularly paced rhythm at 60
beats/minute; the right
ventricle is paced from the outflow tract. ICD interrogation
showed a low OptiVol fluid index. Has been back in atrial
fibrillation since [**2111-11-25**]. Over the past 12 months, this has
been his sixth episode of atrial fibrillation starting [**Month (only) 956**],
[**2111**].
.
The patient was scheduled for a pulmonary vein isolation on the
day of admission.  During the procedure, R groin was
appropriately accessed in the vein, L groin was arterially
accessed.  Procedure was terminated and patient was taken away
to the OR for urgent arterial closure. No PVI was performed.  He
underwent endarterectomy of the LCF with bovine patch with a
drain left in place.  Sheath removed by EP fellow.

PERTINENT LABS AND STUDIES
CXR [**12-19**] 1. Left transvenous pacer unchanged. A right internal
jugular central line with its tip in the mid SVC unchanged. A
nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and an
endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the
carina.
2. Stable cardiac enlargement with interval improvement in
aeration in the
lungs consistent with resolving pulmonary edema. There is
persistent
retrocardiac opacity and likely layering effusion which may
reflect
compressive atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely
excluded. No
pneumothorax.

[**12-20**] Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with several mildly dilated
loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant. The imaging
appearance would favor
postoperative ileus, but early small bowel obstruction cannot be
excluded.  Prominent amount of gas within a moderately distended
stomach. Followup imaging should be considered. No evidence of
free air.

[**12-22**] ECHO Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the
left atrium. Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. LV systolic function appears depressed. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate spontaneous echo contrast in the left
atrial appendage without organized thrombus. Diffuse and complex
aortic atherosclerosis without mobile components.

[**12-23**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST Subtle changes in the posterior
left parietal lobe in the left MCA territory concerning for
early acute infarction. Urgent neurology consult is recommended.
If MRI is contraindicated and additional imaging is required, CT
perfusion scan may be utilized

CT HEAD/NECK WITH CONTRAST [**12-23**] 1. No acute intracranial
abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
56M with PMHx significant for atrial fibrillation on dabigatran
and previously on Amiodarone (s/p multiple cardioversions, most
recently [**2111-11-20**]), CAD s/p multiple PCI (BMS to LAD, multiple
BMS to RCA in [**2100**]; [**2101**] ISRS of RCA and proximal RCA stent;
[**2104**] DES x2 to proximal and distal RCA), dilated cardiomyopathy
(EF 20% s/p [**Company **] ICD), PAD, HTN, HLD, OSA presenting to the
CCU after arterial puncture s/p surgical repair c/b hypotension.


ACUTE CARE
#Left femoral artery repair - Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
for a PVI for refractory Afib.  The beginning of the procedure
was complicated by inadvertent arterial puncture x3 in the left
groin.  Pressure was applied and vascular surgery was consulted.
 He was taken for surgical repair of the left common femoral,
superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries with bovine
patch amgioplasty.  A JP drain was initially placed and was
subsequently removed after drainage had slowed.  There was
evidence of a seroma after the drain was removed which was
managed conservatively.

#Hypotension - Upon presentation to the CCU, he was hypotensive
and briefly required dopamine and phenylepherine to maintain his
MAP >60.  The hypotension was thought to be related to the
sedation used during his procedure and subsequent surgery, he
did not appear hypovolemic and there was no evidence of
cardiogenic shock.

#Rhythm/atrial fibrillation (CHADS2=2) - Pt has refractory AF
with multiple prior cardioversions and trial of many
antiarrhythmics, including amiodarone.  He was supposed to have
a PVI which was aborted because of the arterial puncture
mentioned above.  During this admission, he remained in artial
fibrillation with intermittent V-pacing on telemetry while he
was in the CCU.  In an attempt to chemically convert him to NSR,
he was started on doeftilide after a TEE was negative for
thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] RA.  At discharge, his rhythm was NSR
after well-tolerated DCCV.  He was anticoagulated with
dabigatran after the femoral artery repair operation.  His rate
remained well controlled during this admission.

#Pump/coronaries - He has a history of CAD with multiple prior
stents.  He had a cath in [**10/2110**] which showed non-obstructive
coronary disease and did not report any chest pain during this
admission.  His ASA and Plavix were initially held after the
arterial puncture with repair, but were restarted after
discussion with vascular surgery.

#Mental status changes - On hospital day 5, after transfer from
the CCU to the floor, he was noted to appear more confused and
was using words inappropriately.  There were no focal neurologic
defecits noted, however there was ongoing concern that his
mental status was declining and a non-contrast head CT was
obtained.  There was initial concern for a stroke in the left
MCA distribution and a code stroke was called, NIHSS was 0.  A
CT perfusion was obtained which showed no evidence of ischemia.
The initial thought was that he may have global hypoperfusion
from severe carotid stenosis with mild hypotension.  This
concern was also dismissed and the prevailing theory was that
his mental status changes were a result of delirium from a
combination of oxazepam and ambien.

#Dilated cardiomyopathy (EF=15-20%) - He initially appeared
volume overloaded on exam and his family gave a history of
worsening dyspnea and LE edema prior to presentation (patient
was intubated and initially unable to provide history).  There
was no clear precipitating cause, although reverting back to
afib after his last cardioversion likely contributed.  He was
treated with a lasix drip at admission and diuresed well.  After
the lasix drip was stopped, we slowly added back his home dose
of oral lasix as his blood pressure tolerated.  We initially
held his ramipril and Coreg because of the hypotension, these
were also slowly added back as his BP allowed.  At discharge,
his weight is 92.6kg and his volume status is slightly
hypervolemic.

CHRONIC CARE
#Hypertension - He was hypotensive upon arrival to the CCU and,
as above, his Coreg, ramipril and eleprenone were initially
held.  These were slowly restarted and at discharge he will
continue on his home regimen except a decreased dose of
carvedilol.

#Hypothyroidism - Continued on levothyroxine 50mcg daily.

#Hyperlipidemia - Continued atorvastatin and Zetia

#COPD - Noted on CT scan prior to admission, not reporting any
wheezing at admission.  He does not take any medications at home

Date of Birth:   [**2090-1-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year old
female admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**2141-1-4**] with intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage.  She
was struck by a motor vehicle by walking.  Serial CT scans at
that time showed stability of the bleed in her brain and she
was discharged.

The patient presented on [**2141-1-6**] with failure to
thrive, decreased activity and decreased intake.  She denied
headache, she denied visual changes, she had no fevers or
chills, she had no diarrhea or vomiting.  She developed
diabetic ketoacidosis over the first 24 to 48 hours in the
hospital.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was started on a regular insulin drip with
electrolyte repletion significant for marked
hypophosphatemia.  She was more alert and was transferred to
the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus, patient was on a stable dose of
Glargine HS and lispro before meals.
2.  Essential thrombocytosis, status post cerebrovascular
accident, on aspirin at the time of presentation, stroke in
[**2136**] presumably due to essential thrombocytosis.
3.  Mastectomy in [**2127**] on right, patient did not undergo
radiation or chemotherapy at that time, no recurrence;
reconstruction in [**2136**].
4.  Motor vehicle accident, as stated above, complicated by
subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraparenchymal bleed; three
fractures in the lower back.

ALLERGIES:  Intravenous contrast.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glargine 24 units q.p.m. on a
lispro scale before meals and Neutra-Phos.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated above, the patient was initially
admitted to the neurosurgical service for monitoring.  While
she remained neurologically stable with detailed serial
examinations being unremarkable for any acute changes, she
did develop diabetic ketoacidosis over the first 24 to 48
hours.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, where she received intravenous insulin as well as fluid
and electrolyte repletion.  Of note, she required intravenous
phosphorous repletion.

On [**2141-1-9**], the patient's anion gap had closed to
the point that it was safe for her to be transferred to the
medical floor.  Her examination at that time was as follows:
Generally, she was tired, comfortable, oriented to person and
place; she spoke in full sentences.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  She had a left occipital hematoma 6 x 8 cm,
tender to palpation, she also had a left frontal hematoma
approximately 3 x 2 cm, the calvaria were intact, pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light from 4 mm to 2 mm,
extraocular movements intact without nystagmus, fundi had
sharp disks, V to A ratio less than 3:2, there were no
hemorrhages, there was no exudate.

Neck:  Jugular veins were flat, there was no carotid bruit,
thyroid was not palpable, full range of motion, left external
jugular vein catheter in  place, not warm or tender.  Nodes:
No cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, normal S1 and S2, no S3, no S4, no
murmur, rub or gallop.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen: Thin, soft, normal bowel sounds,
tender to palpation on right flank without rebound or
guarding, liver edge not palpable.  Extremities:  Wearing
compression stockings, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no
calf tenderness.  Vascular:  Radial, carotid, dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses +2 bilaterally.

Neurologic:  Patient had a constricted affect but was
euthymic, she had slow clear speech, normal thought content
and process, no suicidal or homicidal ideations, intact short
and long term memory; cranial nerves I and VIII not tested
formally, cranial nerves II, III, IV, VI, pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact
without nystagmus, as above, cranial nerves V, VII, normal
facial sensation bilaterally, symmetric face, could elevate
brow and puff cheeks, cranial nerves IX, X, XII, tongue
midline, normal gag reflex, could phonate, cranial nerve [**Doctor First Name 81**],
normal sternocleidomastoid (SCM) strength bilaterally, neck
with full range of motion, normal shoulder shrug; motor [**6-19**]
upper and lower extremities bilaterally, median, radial and
ulnar nerves normal bilaterally; sensation, proprioception
and light touch (microfilament) intact; deep tendon reflexes,
biceps +2 bilaterally, brachial radialis +2 bilaterally,
patella +1 bilaterally; cerebellum, rapid hand movements
normal.

The patient's neurologic examination, as stated above,
remained stable for the remainder of her stay. Her hospital
course was marked by a slight increase in her evening
Glargine dose up to 36 units as well as an increase in her
insulin sliding scale lispro.  She remained off of aspirin
for the duration of her stay.  This decision was made in
consultation with the hematology service.

By hospital day three, the patient was taking adequate oral
intake such that intravenous fluids were stopped.  The
intravenous nausea medication, Zofran, was also stopped.  The
patient no longer required intravenous pantoprazole.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glargine 36 units q.p.m. and lispro sliding scale with
meals; of note, this scale will likely be adjusted by the
patient's endocrinologist given that her head trauma resolved
completely, the insulin demands will likely go down.
2.  The patient has taken metoprolol in hospital.  The
decision to continue this will be made by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**] when the
patient returns to his office for follow-up.
3.  Likewise, the patient is currently off of aspirin but
will restart this medication after seeing Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has an appointment with her
neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**2141-3-2**] at 1:00 p.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES
1.  As above.
2.  Diabetic ketoacidosis.

lispro scale before meals and Neutra-Phos.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated above, the patient was initially
admitted to the neurosurgical service for monitoring.  While
she remained neurologically stable with detailed serial
examinations being unremarkable for any acute changes, she
did develop diabetic ketoacidosis over the first 24 to 48
hours.  She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, where she received intravenous insulin as well as fluid
and electrolyte repletion.  Of note, she required intravenous
phosphorous repletion.

On [**2141-1-9**], the patient's anion gap had closed to
the point that it was safe for her to be transferred to the
medical floor.  Her examination at that time was as follows:
Generally, she was tired, comfortable, oriented to person and
place; she spoke in full sentences.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  She had a left occipital hematoma 6 x 8 cm,
tender to palpation, she also had a left frontal hematoma
approximately 3 x 2 cm, the calvaria were intact, pupils
equal, round, and reactive to light from 4 mm to 2 mm,
extraocular movements intact without nystagmus, fundi had
sharp disks, V to A ratio less than 3:2, there were no
hemorrhages, there was no exudate.

Neck:  Jugular veins were flat, there was no carotid bruit,
thyroid was not palpable, full range of motion, left external
jugular vein catheter in  place, not warm or tender.  Nodes:
No cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, normal S1 and S2, no S3, no S4, no
murmur, rub or gallop.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen: Thin, soft, normal bowel sounds,
tender to palpation on right flank without rebound or
guarding, liver edge not palpable.  Extremities:  Wearing
compression stockings, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no
calf tenderness.  Vascular:  Radial, carotid, dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses +2 bilaterally.

Neurologic:  Patient had a constricted affect but was
euthymic, she had slow clear speech, normal thought content
and process, no suicidal or homicidal ideations, intact short
and long term memory; cranial nerves I and VIII not tested
formally, cranial nerves II, III, IV, VI, pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact
without nystagmus, as above, cranial nerves V, VII, normal
facial sensation bilaterally, symmetric face, could elevate
brow and puff cheeks, cranial nerves IX, X, XII, tongue
midline, normal gag reflex, could phonate, cranial nerve [**Doctor First Name 81**],
normal sternocleidomastoid (SCM) strength bilaterally, neck
with full range of motion, normal shoulder shrug; motor [**6-19**]
upper and lower extremities bilaterally, median, radial and
ulnar nerves normal bilaterally; sensation, proprioception
and light touch (microfilament) intact; deep tendon reflexes,
biceps +2 bilaterally, brachial radialis +2 bilaterally,
patella +1 bilaterally; cerebellum, rapid hand movements
normal.

The patient's neurologic examination, as stated above,
remained stable for the remainder of her stay. Her hospital
course was marked by a slight increase in her evening
Glargine dose up to 36 units as well as an increase in her
insulin sliding scale lispro.  She remained off of aspirin
for the duration of her stay.  This decision was made in
consultation with the hematology service.

By hospital day three, the patient was taking adequate oral
intake such that intravenous fluids were stopped.  The
intravenous nausea medication, Zofran, was also stopped.  The
patient no longer required intravenous pantoprazole.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glargine 36 units q.p.m. and lispro sliding scale with
meals; of note, this scale will likely be adjusted by the
patient's endocrinologist given that her head trauma resolved
completely, the insulin demands will likely go down.
2.  The patient has taken metoprolol in hospital.  The
decision to continue this will be made by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**] when the
patient returns to his office for follow-up.
3.  Likewise, the patient is currently off of aspirin but
will restart this medication after seeing Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has an appointment with her
neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**2141-3-2**] at 1:00 p.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES
1.  As above.
2.  Diabetic ketoacidosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1120**] is a 79-year-old woman
who presented to the [**Hospital6 1109**] on [**1-6**]
with complaint of chest pain which occurred following
vomiting coffee ground material.  She underwent a cardiac
catheterization which showed 40-50 percent left main,
proximal LAD, diagonal, circumflex, OM and PDA stenosis.
Unable to evaluate ejection fraction due to ectopy with
likely posterolateral hypokinesis.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], on the day of admission to
[**Hospital1 **], for coronary artery bypass grafting, but had large
volume of hemoptysis.  She was transferred to the CCU and
underwent upper GI endoscopy which revealed duodenitis,
hiatal hernia, gastritis, with no active bleeding.  She was
placed on IV Protonix, anticoagulation was stopped, and she
had no further evidence of bleeding over the next two days.
She was then cleared by the GI service to proceed with
coronary artery bypass grafting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ultimately, on [**1-11**] the patient was
brought to the operating room where she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting.  Please see the OR report for full
details.  In summary, the patient had a CABG x 5 with a LIMA
to the diag, saphenous vein graft to the LAD, saphenous vein
graft to the ramus, saphenous vein graft to the OM, and
saphenous vein graft to the PDA.  Her bypass time was 97
minutes with a crossclamp time of 78 minutes.  She tolerated
the operation well and was transferred from the operating
room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time
of transfer, the patient had Levophed at 0.03 mcg/kg/min,
Nitroglycerin at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, lidocaine at 2 mg/min and
propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  On the course of the
operative day, she was also weaned from her Levophed drip as
well, and her Nitroglycerin was titrated to control periods
of hypertension postoperatively.  The patient also remained
on a lidocaine drip overnight.

On postoperative day 1, the lidocaine drip was discontinued.
The patient was transitioned from IV Nitroglycerin to oral
beta blockers, following which the IV Nitroglycerin was
weaned off.

catheter, and chest tubes were removed, and she was
transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next two days, the
patient had an uneventful postoperative course.  Her activity
level was increased with the assistance of the nursing staff,
as well as physical therapy, and on postoperative day 3 the
patient was considered to be stable and ready to transfer to

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
101.6, pulse 92, blood pressure 132/94, respirations 23, O2
saturation 96% on 4 liters of oxygen nasal cannula.  General:
Elderly, demented man lying in bed in no acute distress with
contractures.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils:
Left pupil fixed and dilated, right pupil reactive.
Oropharynx is dry with dentures and hardware in place.  Neck:
No LAD, no JVD.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, regular rate,
systolic ejection murmur best heard at the axilla.  Lungs:
rhonchi bilaterally anteriorly, significant upper airway

nondistended.  Extremities:  No edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.  Right leg externally rotated.
Neurologic:  Nonresponsive, does not follow commands or

upper extremity.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 27.7, hematocrit
40.3, and platelets 604.  Differential:  80% neutrophils, 6
bands.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.8, chloride 105, bicarb 22,
BUN 42, creatinine 0.9, glucose 192.  Anion gap 13.
Urinalysis:  Greater than 50 white blood cells, few bacteria,
moderate yeast.  Lactate 4.8.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 118, wandering
baseline ST depression in leads V2 and V3, 0.5-1 mm.

Chest x-ray:  Left lower lobe infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Sepsis:  Patient admitted with fever, tachycardia,
leukocytosis and lactic acidosis suggestive of sepsis.  Given
his laboratory and radiological findings, he is thought to
have a likely aspiration pneumonia and along with a
concurrent UTI.

Patient was treated for sepsis per protocol.  He received
multiple fluid boluses to keep his CVP greater than 8.  His
blood pressure was maintained with fluid resuscitation.  He
did not require any pressor support.  A CO2 were monitored
and patient was maintained on oxygen via nasal cannula.  He
was started on IV antibiotics initially Vancomycin, ceftazidime,
and Flagyl.  Patient improved clinically on antibiotics.  The
etiology of his sepsis was thought to be due to aspiration
pneumonia with concurrent UTI.  His stool also grew out
Clostridium difficile colitis, which also contributed to his
septic picture.

Patient was transitioned over to p.o. antibiotics with plan
to treat him with Levaquin and Flagyl for a total of 14 days.
Patient's sputum did not grow out a contributing organism.
He did have sparse MRSA in his sputum, which was thought to
be a contamination as patient is colonized with MRSA.

2. Aspiration pneumonia:  Patient with recurrent aspiration
pneumonia.  Patient has previous admissions for similar
aspiration pneumoniae.  He had a failed swallowing study in
the past, however, his family does not feel patient would
want a PEG tube, feeding tube, or other invasive measures.
They were cautioned that he is at risk for recurrent
aspiration pneumoniae, however, they still declined any sort
of invasive feeding measures.  Patient was treated for
aspiration pneumonia as per the above sepsis description.

Patient was eventually weaned off oxygen and maintained
excellent saturations on room air.  He did occasionally have
mucus plugs with very brief desaturation down to
approximately 90% which cleared with coughing.  He will be
continued on chest PT at the nursing home.  The nursing home
will be instructed that should he desaturate, this typically
clears with coughing and this is not worrisome as long as his
saturations normalize with a cough and clearing of the mucus.

3. Clostridium difficile colitis:  Patient's stool from
[**10-8**] grew out Clostridium difficile.  He was
recently on antibiotics, which likely contributed to his
infection.  He was started on p.o. Flagyl with plans to treat
for 14 days.  His symptoms of diarrhea quickly resolved with
treatment.

4. Coronary artery disease:  Patient with history of coronary
artery disease status post CABG.  Upon admission, he was
tachycardic with slight ST depression in leads V2 and V3.
This was thought to be a strain pattern due to his
tachycardia and septic picture.  Patient was also ruled out
for a myocardial infarction.  His cardiac enzymes were
negative and his EKG changes resolved with treatment of his
other symptoms.  He was continued on aspirin, and initially
his statin and beta blocker were held in the setting of
sepsis.  However, these were restarted prior to discharge.
He also was started on low dose ACE inhibitor.

5. Afib:  Patient with a history of AFib.  A decision made to
not anticoagulate given his high risk for falls.  Patient
went in and out of AFib during the hospitalization.  He was
restarted on metoprolol for rate control.

6. Hypothyroidism:  Patient continued on Levoxyl per his home
regimen.

7. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient started back
on puree foods, which he tolerated well.  He was also placed
on Boost supplement drinks.  He was thought to be at risk of
aspiration as per above, however, his family did not desire
any invasive measures, so p.o. was continued despite his risk
for recurrent aspiration.  His electrolytes were followed
throughout the hospitalization, and were repleted as needed.

8. Prophylaxis:  Patient was placed on aspiration and fall
precautions.  He was also on H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis,
subcutaneous Heparin for DVT prophylaxis and a bowel regimen.

9. Code status:  Patient was initially full code on
admission, however, later in the hospital course following an
extensive discussion with the family, his wife made the
decision as his health care proxy to make the patient
DNR/DNI.  Patient was discharged with DNR/DNI status,
however, they did wish him to be rehospitalized should he
decompensate.

Date of Birth:   [**2136-9-27**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Surgery, Purple Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old gentleman
with a history of nonfamilial polyposis of the colon,
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for consideration of total
colectomy.  The patient has polyps extending from the cecum
to middle rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of chronic
pancreatitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease.  The
patient's pancreatitis is felt to be secondary to alcohol
which he has been cited to have a problem with.  [**Name2 (NI) **] states
that he has almost quit drinking at this point.  Other past
medical history includes removal of a portion of the right
lung, not otherwise specified, in [**2167**]; a ""cyst.""

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prilosec, pancreatic enzymes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history positive for tobacco use and
abuse.  Positive for abusive of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission revealed
vital signs were height of 5 feet 11 inches, weight 170
pounds, pulse 96, blood pressure 134/76.  Mental status was
alert and oriented.  The patient was a vague historian.  Neck
was supple.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities
were without edema.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Flexible sigmoidoscopy 30 cm, head
sparing, one small polyp in the lower rectum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2194-12-8**].  On the day of
admission he had a colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.
The surgery was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], assisted by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 14966**].  Please see previously dictated Operative Note
for more details.

His immediate postoperative course was complicated by
tachycardia and hematocrit which went from 43 to 23.  Of
note, the patient was a difficult intubation for the
operation.  A 6.5 French tube was maximum that could be
inserted.  Intubation required fiberoptic intubation.

The patient was brought back to the operating room from the
Postanesthesia Care Unit for an exploratory laparotomy.
Exploratory laparotomy revealed roughly 3 liters of blood in
the abdomen; although, there was no evidence of ongoing
bleeding.  Intraoperatively, he was transfused 4 units of
packed red blood cells and was transferred to the
Postanesthesia Care Unit with stable hemodynamics.

His second operation was complicated by trauma to his
dentition.  He lost four teeth during the emergent intubation
on the second operation.  In the Postanesthesia Care Unit,
his vital signs were stable, and he was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was left intubated in the Intensive
Care Unit.

The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit until
postoperative five.  The patient had a prolonged Intensive
Care Unit stay for several reasons.  He had a large amount of
bright red blood per rectum.  This was dealt with by
following serial hematocrits and transfusing 2 units of
packed red blood cells.  The patient's hematocrit remained
stable, and there was no evidence of ongoing bleeding.  In
addition, the patient has a history of alcohol use and abuse.
He was covered with a CIWA scale and Ativan for delirium
tremens prophylaxis.  Despite this, he had some mental status
changes thought possibly to be consistent with delirium
tremens.  He never entered full blown delirium tremens during
his stay in the Intensive Care Unit.

By postoperative day five he was felt to be stable to
transfer to the patient care floor.  On the floor he was
started on a regular diet by postoperative six.
Unfortunately, he became distended, had emesis, and abdominal
discomfort.  For this his diet was changed back to n.p.o.
His diet was intermittently advanced over the next several
days.  It was during this time he had large amounts of stool
output.  The stool output had to be matched with lactated
Ringer's for several days in order to maintain his hydration
status.  Eventually, by postoperative day 11 stool output
began to decrease.  The p.r.n. Imodium that the patient had
been receiving was decreased from t.i.d. to p.r.n.

By postoperative day 15 the patient was tolerating a regular
diet without significant distention.   His pain was well
controlled.  His stool output had decreased to approximately
600 cc per day.  The patient was able to be discharged to
home.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Pancrease 20 two to three capsules with each meal.
2.  Imodium 2 mg p.o. p.r.n. for diarrhea.
3.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
4.  Metamucil.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post colectomy with ileorectal
anastomosis for polyposis coli, status post exploratory
laparotomy for bleeding, status post traumatic intubation
with loss of four teeth.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please
call Dr.[**Name (NI) 10946**] clinic for an appointment.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-10-20**] 10:12 PM
IMPRESSION: Several large ring-enhancing lesions in the
cerebellum. In the setting of advanced metastatic colon cancer,
as this patient is known to have, these probably represent colon
cancer metastases. No definite hemorrhage, although there is
moderately dense material surrounding the lesions on the
pre-contrast imaging. Non-communicating hydrocephalus is
present, associated with either occlusion or high-grade
obstruction of the ventricular system. Findings discussed with
the covering team shortly after the study and put to the ER
dashboard as well.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: As above, there is considerable
mass effect within the posterior fossa with inferior herniation
of the cerebellar tonsils.
.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2115-6-14**]:
Lung volumes are lower and multiple pulmonary nodules most
likely metastases are new. There is also generalized
interstitial abnormality which may represent lymphatic tumor
invasion. Small left pleural effusion is present. Heart is
normal size. Tip of the right subclavian infusion port projects
over the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
.
CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2118-10-22**] 4:39 PM
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C
IMPRESSION:
1. Substantial progression of disease with interval increase in
size and number of pulmonary lesions and more extensive
metastatic involvement of the liver. Increased mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
2. New, small left pleural effusion.
.
.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-10-22**] 2:12 AM
IMPRESSION: Rim-enhancing lesion in both cerebellar hemispheres
consistent with metastatic disease. Moderate obstructive
hydrocephalus. Edema involving the cerebellar hemispheres with
slightly low position of the cerebellar tonsils.
.
.

chronic foley, SDH, severe dementia, s/p recent hospital
admission, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from nursing home w/ diarrhea,
dark urine in foley, tachycardia, SOB, loose stools. Pt had
recently been hospitalized twice at an OSH, first in an ICU for
sepsis requiring pressors, vancomycin and zosyn, and was d/ced
on linezolid. He was then re-admitted to the hospital from
[**9-23**]->[**9-28**] w/ enterococcus bacteremia thought [**1-28**] to his stage
IV decubitis ulcer. This was treated with cefepime then unasyn
during that second hospital course, and again discharged on
linezolid to a nursing home.
.
On day of admission to  [**Hospital1 18**] pt  was febrile, tachycardic, with
SBP 70's-90's responsive to IVF. Pt had labs sent, urine, blood,
stool cxs sent. Pt was given vanco, zosyn, flagyl, rectal
tylenol in ED, and approximately 3-4 L IVF resuscitation. ED
course also notable for code status discussion with pt's family
with translater present. Per this discussion, pt's code status
was changed from DNR/DNI to full code.
.
He was admitted on [**10-19**] to  MICU .He was treated with broad
spectrum abx.Only positive cultures were urine with yeast.Stool
with c.difficile. Antibiotics were tailored to flagyl only to
treat for c. difficile.  A new family  meeting was held and
patient was made DNR/DNI by his daughter.
.
Patient was transferred to the a Medicine floor 3 days after
admission . After a staying on the floor for 4 days he  was
transferred back to the medical ICU d/2 respiratory distress
.This happened  soon after contrast for a CT scan of the abdomen
 was administered through  the PEG tube. Patient's oxygenation
was escalated from nasal cannula to face mask to NRB, with sats
initially in mid-70s and improving to mid-90s with aformentioned
interventions. Patient also noted to be rigoring, and demerol
was administered via IV. Concern for aspiration event vs.
sepsis. Patient with accompanying tachycardia to 150s (baseline
100s-120s), BP stable with systolic in 110-120s
He was admitted to the MICU for further managament.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 79M chronically-ill gentleman with multiple
medical issues including C. Diff colitis, Stage IV sacral
decubitus ulcer, leukocytosis, dementia transferred from floor
[**1-28**] respiratory distress, likely aspiration event:
.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
From history of event occurring soon after contrast was
administered with suctioning of contrast, as well as recent
portable CXR findings consistent with aspiration event, latter
was the most likely diagnosis. Patient's respiratory status
improved over the next 2 days with improvement in oxygenation
and tachypnea. His SpO2 was 98 % on RA on discharge. He was
covered broadly with Vancomycin/Zosyn  for 4 days for coverage
of underlying  aspiration PNA, in setting of patient with
bandemia and multiple hospital admissions.
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS
Patient had  with marked leukocytosis  with bandemia on
admission to [**Hospital1 18**], etiologies mutlifactorial. He was initially
treated for sepsis of unknown origin with Vanc /Zosyn and Flagyl
for C diff colitis. Zosyn and Vanc were discontinued after C
diff returned positive . WBC improved however increased while
being on the floor. Vanc and Zosyn were restarted for civerage
of nosocomial pneumonia in setting of aspiration (see above).
CxR c/w aspiration PNA. He also had a stage IV decubitus ulcer
which did not grossly appear infected but is followed by wound
care team.
.
# C. DIFFICILE COLITIS
Patient has been on multiple antibiotic regimens over the last
several months.  Patient started on Flagyl [**2151-10-19**]; C diff came
back positive on [**10-21**]. Given persistent leukocytosis, diarrhea,
and residence in nursing facility and multiple hospitalizations,
there was concern for resistant organisms; PO Vanc added to
regimen on [**10-26**]. He should continue oral Vancomycin and Flagyl
for a total of 3 weeks ( 1 more week than normal ) considering
he is being treated for aspiration pneumonia.

# UTI: Pt w/ h/o BPH w/ urinary retention and indwelling foley,
pre-disposing him to UTI. Urine culture grew yeast twice while
in house.
Foley changed, Fluconazole started on [**10-25**].
He should finish  for 14 days total.
.
# Anemia
Patient with anemia of chronic disease . DIC labs negative
Guiaic negative on exam this AM. No obvious sources of bleed on
physical examination. Given respiratory status he was transfused
1 unit PRBCs for improved oxygenation. His hematocrit remained
stable at 24%.
.
# TACHYCARDIA
Patient had Sinus tachycardia during hospitalization. Patient
afebrile, with baseline HR in 100s on this admission, with
recent escalation during event of respiratory distress and
dehydration, improved with hydration and transfusion of blood.
On dischrge his HR remained near 90s.
.
# SACRAL DECUB ULCER: Pt w/ stage IV decub ulcer, thought to be
the situs of his enterococcus faecalis bacteremia in [**9-1**]. Per
OSH records, sensitive to Vancomycin. Wound care nurse followed
during whole hospital admission. Blood cxs remained negative.
MRI was considered  to r/o osteo . However since  wound looked
clean and patient had had long term abx treatment and had C diff
secondary to this ,  it was decided to treat wound  with topical
therapy.
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient's Creatinine was 3.2 on
admission. Imporved to 1.3 on discharge . Most likely cause was
pre-renal azotemia  secondary to intravascular volume depletion.
Medications should be all renally dosed.
.
# TROPONIN ELEVATION:
Troponin elevated at 0.23 on admission, CK  reamained flat. Trop
down to 0.15  after adequate fluid resuscitation.Most likely due
to cardiac ischemia in the setting of sepsis.  Will no longer
follow.
.
# DEMENTIA: Pt w/ h/o dementia, apparently non-verbal at
baseline. Not on any medications.  Head CT   large cystic
lesion in the frontal lobe c/w old stroke and microvascular
dementia. F/U CT remained unchanged..
.
# FEN:
TFs held  initially due to recent aspiration event. He was
discharged on Probalance at a rate of 40 cc/h.
.
# PPX: SC heparin, Zantac
.
# ACCESS: PICC Line that was placed on [**10-26**]
.
# CODE: Per family meeting on [**10-20**], DNR/DNI; Goals of care
addressed .
.
# COMMUNICATION: Family contacts (2 [**Name2 (NI) 9005**], grandsons)
.
# DISPO
She is being transferred to a rahab facility.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per recturm with hemodynamic instability

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Right femoral line placement
2. EGD with vessel clipping

History of Present Illness:
30 y/o female with history of AML s/p allo BMT in [**12-7**] and
relapse detected in [**5-8**] now s/p MEC treatment ([**6-8**]) and DLI on
[**7-29**] and GVHD (leg pain, high LFT's) admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2106-8-17**]
for hematochezia.  She is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BRBPR
and hemodynamic instability.
.
The current presentation started on Sunday, [**2106-8-15**], when the pt
recalls that she had 1 episode of painless, bright red bloody
emesis.  She says that the amount was small, less than 1 cup.
Monday, [**2106-8-16**], she had dark clotted blood with BM and less
yesterday [**2106-8-17**].  She was transferred from an OSH today for
further management.
.
On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she appeared comfortable to the admitting
resident and had no complaints (and specifically denied
abdominal pain).  At about 2:30 am today, she had a large,
marroon stool mixed with melena.  Her BP, which was 120s/70s on
arrival went to 90/60; her HR which was 70s on arrival went to
130s.  2 emergency-released units of prbcs were initiated.  She
was bolused 1000cc NS and an 80 mg pantoprazole bolus was
ordered.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], HR had decreased to the 90s but BP was
86/39.  She was mentating well and c/o rle pain and mild nausea.
 Pt denied current LH/dizziness, abd pain, CP, dyspnea/SOB.  2
events quickly ensued.
.
First, the blood bank called to let us know that the 2 units
running were JKB incompatible.  The transufusion was stopped,
the BMT fellow and blood bank resident on call were apprised and
2 units of cross-matched blood were rapidly procured.
.
Next, as the units ran in, the pt c/o LH and vomited
approximately 200c BRB. A femoral line was inserted and 3 units
were rapidly transfused.  The GI fellow, who had been called on
transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], arrived with the attending for emergent
EGD.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HX: She was first noticed to have leukocytosis and
thrombocytosis several years ago and a bone marrow bx at that
time revealed reactive marrow without dysplastic changes. At the

time of the birth of her daughter in [**12-6**] she was found to be
anemic and thrombocytopenic with immature circulating blasts and
a bone marrow showed 9% blast forms and cytogenetics showed an
8;21 translocation. She underwent 7+3 induction in [**1-7**] followed
by consolidation with HiDAC times three. She underwent an
alloSCT with cyto/TBI on [**2105-12-3**].  Her course was c/b mucositis,

neutropenic fever, and vaginal bleeding, resolved by the time of

her discharge.  She had a positive blood cultures thought due to

line infection with coag-neg. Staph in [**2-8**] and [**3-8**], and her
Hickman was d/c'd.  She had some acute stage I skin GVHD in [**4-7**]

that responded to low dose steroids.
.
Relapse detected in [**5-8**], confirmed with FISH. During admission
in [**2106-6-3**], patient received MEC therapy with good result;
repeat bone marrows have been without evidence of AML. She is
status post DLI on [**7-29**].

Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed: The patient was initially admitted to BMT for
management of her GIB.  However, her Hct dropped from 27-20 over
a couple hours, and had a bloody bowel movement.  She  had
hemodynamic instability, with decreased BP to the 80's systolic
and HR >130.  She was transfused 3 units PRBCs.  The ICU team
was called, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for urgent EGD.
In the ICU, she had 200ml of hematemesis.  A protonix drip was
started.  A right femoral line was successfully placed for fluid
resusitation.  She was given NS and 2 additional units at that
time.  GI arrived and performed a EGD.  They found a bleeding
vessel but could not cauterize it.  They then successfully
clipped the vessel.  Post procedure, she was given 2 units of
FFP and 1 unit Platelets with a good response.  Her Hct was
followed q4.  Overnight, her Hct fell from 32 - 27.  She was
given 2 more units of PRBCs with an appropriate response.  On
[**8-19**], GI re-scoped her to re-assess the clips.  The clips were
shown to be intact. Over the course of her ICU stay she received
a total of 11 units of blood products. She was transferred back
to floor on [**2106-8-21**] and her henatocrit has been stable since.
.
# GVHD: The patient has known graft versus host disease of the
liver.  She was recently started on Cellcept [**Pager number **] TID. Also, she
is receiving Prednisone 50mg daily. Her bilitubin has been high
but slowly declining during her stay. She should continue on the
regimen above with the goal of decreasing her steroid dose.
.
# Bacteremia: Three bottles of blood cultures on two different
days were positive for coagulase negative staphylococci. The
patient's line was not pulled per attending (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], but
therapy with vancomycin through the line was initiated on
[**2106-8-19**]. Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 59575**] remained afebrile during the entire stay on
the floor. She will need continued IV antibiotic therapy for a
total of forteen days (last day [**2106-9-1**]).
.
# CMV Infection: Mrs [**Known lastname 59574**] was started on onduction therapy for
CMV infection. We switched her on oral Valganciclovir 900 [**Hospital1 **]
the day before discharge. During the induction period (21 days)
valganciclovir is taken twice daily and then reduced to once
daily. The patient's viral load decreased progressivly during
the course of her stay and was undetectable on they of
discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o male with PMH of cryptogenic cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma s/p RFA, with current MELD of 22 who
presents for OLT. The donor is a 35-year-old donor after cardiac
death. The donor is hemodynamically stable but is a high risk
donor due to recent IV drug abuse with negative serologies. The
recipient is aware of the social history.
Please see the operative note for surgical details. Of note the
patient had extensive adhesions and the left lobe of the liver
was hypertrophied into the splenic bed. The portal vein was
thickened and partially occluded, clot was removed, and
thrombectomy completed on the recipient portal vein. During
course of the hepatectomy, there was constant oozing diffusely
and systolic pressures were in
the 70-90 range. He also required some pressor support during
this time point as well as following reperfusion, which quickly
corrected. After about 10 minutes of hepatic artery reperfusion,
there was poor flow in the hepatic artery. This appeared to be
due to spasm and some topical papaverine was placed on the
hepatic artery. The common hepatic artery was mobilized to the
GDA and the GDA ligated. Following this, there was excellent
flow in the hepatic artery and no further revision was done. The
patient overall tolerated the procedure well and by the end of
the case had systolic pressures in the 100-110 range.
Patient transferred still intubated to the intensive care unit
in stable condition.
He received immunosuppression intra-op and post-op per
transplant protocol.
Patient extubated on POD 1, and has required some O2 support via
NC.
Patient transferred out of the SICU on POD3.
PT consult obtained, patient requiring assistive devices
(walker, cane) due to feeling unsteady.
Patient was placed on insulin drip for elevated blood sugars. On
POD 4, NPH and sliding scale implemented with good response.
Patient will likely discharge home with insulin.
Patient remained on O2. During PT consult, sats dropped to 88%
on RA, improved to 91% on 2L. Lasix given IV and IS was
encouraged.
Lateral JP drain removed on POD 4 as well as Foley.
On [**3-8**] (POD5) late in the afternoon the patient was sitting in
a chair and was noted by his wife to be flailing arms, and
unable to speak. Patient was transferred to bed by team, briefly
lost consciousness and then slowly regained function.
Approximately 20 minutes later the patient, who had been
speaking with the team, suddenly began making unintelligle
sounds, his eyes rolled back and he clenched his jaw. This
lasted greater than 1 minute. Received Ativan, once stable
underwent head CT and was transferred back to the SICU. He was
also evaluated by the neuro team.
Head CT showed: 1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic lacunar infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Patient underwent MR of head and MRA, which showed no evidence
of acute infarct, hemorrhage, or enhancing masses to explain
patient's current seizures. The MR did show changes from chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. MRA was normal with normal
appearing Circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
Patient was transferred back to the surgical floor the following
day. There has been no repeat seizure activity noted. Neuro did
not feel that any medication should be started at this time.
Patient was stable the following two days, liver function tests
continued to improve and patient was ready for discharge home
with home PT and Nursing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male who presented after fracture of
the left femur after feeling weak for 2-3 days at home.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented on [**11-26**] with a fracture of the left femur
after falling while in the bathroom at home.  Imaging revealed a
femur fracture, no intracranial hemorrhage, no vertebral
fractures.  He had been taking coumadin for atrial fibrillation
and had an INR of 1.7 on admission, repeat was 2.2.  It was
noted that his hematocrit on admission was 39 and a follow up
hematocrit was 30.8.  There was concern that Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
bleeding from an unknown source and orthopedic surgery was held
until the patient was medically cleared.  A CXR done on
admission showed a possible PNA in the right upper lobe and the
patient was started on levaquin.  CT chest in the ED ruled out
PE and also raised suspicion for PNA.  CT head showed no bleed,
no acute process.
.
On [**11-27**] subsequent hematocrits were stable and it was felt that
the initial value was likely concentrated due to dehydration.
He was cleared for the OR on [**11-28**].  Of note, the night prior to
going to the OR, he triggered for a SBP of 89 and temperature to
101.9.  He was given a fluid bolus and his blood pressure
responded appropriately.  His antibiotics were not changed at
that time; he remained on levofloxacin.
.
He underwent ORIF of his L femur on [**2119-11-28**], receiving 2 units
of FFP and 2 units of PRBC and following extubation he was
brought to the PACU unresponsive.  He arrived in the PACU in
afib with rates in the 130s-140s.  The pt appeared to be having
difficulty with respiration and his ABG was 7.12/89/114 (unclear
how much FiO2).  He was given Lasix 20 mg IV and after pt was
noted to have repiratory distress; he was reintubated with
etomidate 14 mg and succinylcholine 120mcg.  Propofol was given
and pt was given Lopressor 3 mg IV.  His SBP decreased to the
80s, and he was given a 500 cc bolus with his SBP rising to the
low 100s. A L IJ cordis was placed with 4 mg IV morphine given
prior.  He also received Flagyl 500 mg IVx1 (in addition to the
Levaquin he was taking for PNA).  EKG revealed [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevations in V1-V4 (increased from prior) and stat bedside echo
in the PACU revealed old septal akinesis/hypokinesis.  CXR
revealed persistent RML infiltrate without evidence of volume
overload.  On SIMV 600x12 wtih PEEP 5, PS 5, Rate 12, FiO2 50%
pts ABG was 7.33/44/184.  The pt was weaned on his propofol to
off and he was weaned on his vent to PS at 5/5 with TV of
500-800cc. On arrival to the MICU from the PACU, the pt was
found hypotensive with a SBP in the 60s.  The following is his
subsequent course:
.
#Sepsis/SIRS: Pts SBP was in the 60s on arrival to the ICU with
temp of 103 F.  The pt was started on levophed gtt and bolused 1
L IVF.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test revealed a normal baseline cortisol
level.  A swans-ganz catheter was floated through the L IJ
cordis and revealed a SVR of 700, CVP 14, wedge of 18, SV of 69,
and CO 4.5-6.5.  Thus, the main cause of the pts hypotension was
felt to be sepsis rather than cardiogenic shock.  Over the first
night in the ICU, the pts levophed was weaned off, and he
received a total of 4 L NS and 1 unit PRBC (for hct of 27 and
mixed venous O2 sat of 61%).  The pts SBP rose to the low 100s.
The only source for sepsis was the pts RML PNA.  Blood cx,
sputum cx, and urine cx were negative.  He was called out to the
floor on [**11-30**].  While on the floor, he remained hemodynamically
stable, afebrile.  He will continue a 10 day course of levaquin
and flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia.
.
#Respiratory Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] initial ABG was c/w hypercarbic
resp. distress.  He was unresponsive on arrival to the MICU, so
his hypercarbia was likely due to mental status changes.  His
mental status had greatly improved on the morning after transfer
to the ICU.  In the PACU the pt had already been weaned to PS
[**5-5**] with 50% FiO2, and he was taking in Tv in the 500s with sats
of 93-97%. He was extubated on the morning after transfer to the
ICU without complication.  He was weaned to 2L on [**12-1**] however
O2 sat decreased to 88%.  At that time he was noted to have
crackles at the bases on exam.  As his blood pressure had
improved, he was restarted on lasix for duiresis.  He remains on
2L, satting well at discharge.
.
#CAD/demand ischemia: Immediately following surgery, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
had increased ST elevations in the anterior leads on the EKG
with rapid afib.  These elevations resolved after the HR
decreased.  Per cards, this elevation was likely due to anterior
wall akinesis in the setting of tachycardia.  Stress in [**2112**] had
shown fixed lesions of the apical/septal walls and
akinesis/hypokinesis of these regions.  Stat TTE revealed EF
still severly depressed.  Metoprolol and ACE were held in the
setting of hypotension.  The pts troponin trended up to 0.12
which was likely due to demand ischemia.  Pt was given PR ASA
while intubated and then po ASA and lipitor were restarted after
extubation.  Metoprolol and ACE were held in the setting of
hypotension.  Once hypotension resolved, his beta blocker was
restarted on [**11-30**] and increased to TID on [**12-2**].  A small dose
of an ace inhibitor was restarted on [**12-1**].  He tolerated both
medications well with stable BP.
.
#Altered Mental Status: Pts altered MS seemed to be related to
oversedation as he was mentating better hours later.  DDX
included toxic metabolic, infection, stroke, nonconvulsive
seizure. In addition, the pt was febrile to 103 with PNA, which
could certainly account for altered mental state.   His UA from
[**11-26**] was clear. He was moving all extremities and following
commands, so stroke and seizure were unlikely.  On discharge, he
was mentating well.  He was able to correctly state person,
place and time.
.
#Afib: Pt was in RVR post-op, likely secondary to fluid shifts
and peri-op complication.  Pt spontaneously cardioverted to NSR
after 3 mg lopressor. He was restarted on coumadin after surgery
at a dose of 5mg qhs.  This was changed to 2.5mg.  On the day of
discharge his INR was 2.7 and his discharge coumadin dose is
2.0.
.
#Left Femur Fracture/ 5th metatarsal fracture: Detailed hospital
course above.  After ORIF and MICU course the patient was
transferred to the floor.  Ortho continued to follow and the
patient was able to weight bear on the left leg.  On [**12-2**]
ecchymosis was noted on the left lateral malleolus, heel and
plantar aspect of foot.  A foot xray showed a fracture of the
5th metatarsal, likely incurred from the fall.  He remained pain
free and was comfortable on the day of discharge.  He was
anticoagulated with lovenox, until coumadin level reached >2.0.
Lovenox was d/c'd on [**12-2**].  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**12-21**].
.
#Systolic Dysfunction: Pt has EF 20-25%.  He was given IV fluids
as needed and lasix was initially held due to low blood
pressures.  Lasix was restarted on [**12-2**] for increased O2
requirement and crackles on exam.  This improved his oxygen
saturation and a standing dose was reinitiated on [**12-2**].
.
#DM II: Pt was maintained on SSI while in the hospital.  He will
be discharged on glucophage.
.
#Dementia: Aricept was held while pt was intubated and was
restarted after extubation.  His mental status while not sedated
was appropriate.  He was awake, alert and oriented x3.
.
#GERD: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was given protonix to prevent reflux.
.
#FEN: After extubation and on return to the floor, the patient
was seen by speech and swallow who felt that he could be
advanced to thin liquids and ground solids.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 55 year old male with multiple
medical problems including coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with pacemaker,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, aortic valve
replacement on Coumadin, now with a gastrointestinal bleed
from a likely arteriovenous malformation with an myocardial
infarction in the setting of a hematocrit down to 12.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had an
myocardial infarction with a troponin up to 7.6 in the
setting of her hematocrit down to 12, had chest pain,
multiple times throughout her hospital admission which
responded to Nitroglycerin and Morphine.  The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2117-8-25**].  Total
occlusion of her right coronary artery which appeared chronic
with right to right collaterals and left to right collaterals
to tiny and distant right coronary artery vessels, was not
felt to be repairable with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty or bypass.  Also had a 60% tubular stenosis of
her obtuse marginal 1 which was felt not to be a critical
lesion and did not have the appearance of an unstable plaque,
was not percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied or
sent.  The patient was medically managed for her coronary
artery disease on sublingual nitroglycerins which were
switched to Imdur, was also started on low dose Zestril as
well as Metoprolol and diuresed with Lasix and Metolazone.
The patient returned briefly to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for more aggressive diuresis for right-sided heart
failure with a diuresis of nearly 12 liters during the three
days of her stay there.  At the time of discharge the patient
has subjectively improved her breathing as well as continued
to be chest pain free for over one week with oxygen
saturations consistently in the high 90s to 100% on 2 liters
which is a home oxygen.  For her history of aortic valve
replacement, the patient has been restarted on Coumadin with
a goal INR of 2 to 3, for anticoagulation with the aortic
valve replacement as well as her atrial fibrillation.  She
has not shown any evidence of embolic phenomenon from either
while on heparin.

2.  Infectious disease - Initial presentation was one of
bilateral lower extremity cellulitis which was treated with
intravenous Ancef, was then discontinued after resolution of
her symptoms as well as physical examination appearance.  She
had a brief course of Levofloxacin for a urinary tract
infection.  No evidence of infection currently.

3.  Heme - Hematocrit has been in the range of 29 to 32.  She
has required multiple units of packed red blood cells to
maintain her hematocrit.  She was started on iron and Folate.
She may continue to need transfusions in that she continues
to have blood in her stools.  She will need to stay on
Coumadin for her aortic valve replacement as well as for her
atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

4.  Endocrine - The patient has a history of diabetes for
which she was covered with an insulin sliding scale and was
given NPH insulin with fingersticks in the 100s to 200s.  On
discharge her fingersticks have been more stable in the low
100 range on NPH insulin as well as regular insulin sliding
scale.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient presented with a
gastrointestinal bleed likely from an arteriovenous
malformation in her colon.  These arteriovenous malformations
were discovered on colonoscopy as well as enteroscopy at [**Hospital6 **] showing arteriovenous malformations in
her right colon as well as her transverse colon.  The patient
underwent an interventional radiology embolization of her
right colon after a bleeding scan was suggestive of continued
bleeding in the area.  After the procedure the patient
continued to have melanotic stools which gradually resolved
and continued to be occult blood positive.  The patient may
still have a small amount of bleeding in her colon, however,
it does not warrant further workup at this point, given the
fact that the bleeding is considerably smaller and that
interventional embolization seems to have stopped the major
source of bleeding.  If bleeding continues in the future, the
patient will need to undergo a tagged red blood cell scan to
identify the source and will likely need another
embolization.

6.  Renal - Electrolytes have been stable.  The patient has
not experienced any decrement in her renal function during
the aggressive diuresis.

7.  Disposition - The patient was seen by physical therapy,
was able to walk up to 300 feet with the assistance of a
walker.  Will continue to need home physical therapy as well
as [**Hospital6 407**] and will get a significant
amount of help from her husband at home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed from arteriovenous malformation
2.  Coronary artery disease

effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis versus air space
consolidation

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-16**] - Increased pulmonary parenchymal
density which may represent developing edema.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-3-17**] - Clearing of pulmonary vascular
congestion. No other significant interval change

pleural effusions with increasing left basilar atelectasis or,
less likely, consolidation

ESOPHAGUS  [**2137-3-20**] - Normal esophagogastric anastomosis without
evidence of leak or stricture

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2137-3-21**] - no pneumomediastinum or
pneumothorax

Chest CT : [**2137-3-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental right upper and right middle lobe pulmonary emboli.
2. Small mediastinal lymph nodes and a tiny 3-mm pleural-based
left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. In a patient with a known
malignancy, followup CT scan in [**2-5**] months is recommended.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lower lobe
atelectasis.
4. Status post left splenectomy. There is a simple fluid
collection anterior to the pancreatic head which probably
represents a seroma.
5. Small 9-mm pancreatic head cyst. Interval 3- to 6-month CT
followup is recommended for this finding as well.
6. Diffuse pancolonic diverticula.
7. Adrenal hyperplasia
8. Solitary sub-cm. gallbladder polyp.

[**2137-3-25**]
CT guided needle aspirate of abd collection:
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided aspiration of a peripancreatic
fluid collection anterior to the head of the pancreas. 30 mL of
nonpurulent, brownish, non-foul smelling fluid was aspirated and
sent for microbiology, amylase, lipase, and bilirubin, which are
currently pending.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent his operation on [**2137-3-13**].
His operative course was complicated by splenectomy and distal
pancreatectomy.  He otherwise tolerated the procedures well and
was transferred to the SICU post-op.  He was eventually
transferred to the floor [**3-17**] where he did well.

His pain was controlled with an epidural and PCA.  The acute
pain service was following closely.  His epidural was removed on
[**3-17**].  His PCA was continued and he was eventually transitioned
over to dilaudid po, which controlled his pain well.

CV: Patient developed A. Fib on POD#1 and was started on an
amiodarone drip.  He was hemodynamically stable without
requiring pressors/inotropes.  He was eventually transitioned to
PO amiodarone taper and he converted back to and remained in
sinus rhythm since [**3-16**].

Respiratory: He arrived in SICU intubated and was extubated on
[**3-15**].  His follow-up CXRs revealed a left pleural effusion that
was tapped by IP on [**3-19**] that resulted in 500cc of
serosanguinous fluid.  His pleural fluid had inflammatory cells
but was negative for malignant cells.  Subsequent CXRs showed
stable bilateral pleural effusions.  He responded well to
diuresis. His oxygen requirement remained high despite diuresis
and a Ct scan was done and subsegmenatl PE's were discovered.
Anticoagulation was started with a heparin drip and then
transitioned to lovenox. Coumadin was not started as of date of
discharge.  LE duplex US were negative for DVT.  He was
comfortable on supplemental oxygen via nasal canula and was
eventually discharged with oxygen.

GI: NPO with NGT until bowel function returned, NGT was removed
on [**3-19**] and was started on clears [**3-20**] and advanced to full
liquids.  TF were started @30cc/hr [**3-15**] and was advanced to goal
of 70cc/hr.

GU: His UOP was stable throughout and the Foley catheter was
removed after the epidural was discontinued.  A Foley had to be
replaced after failure to void on [**3-19**].  His Foley was then
removed on [**3-21**] and he voided afterwards.

Heme: His HCT decreased to 22.6 on [**3-15**].  This was most likely
secondary to mediastinal oozing post-op and he was transfused 2
units of blood followed by lasix.  His HCT rose to 25.5 and
stablized there.

ID: spiked temp 101.4 w/ elevated WBC to 22K [**3-15**].  His blood
and urine were cultured and were negative for infection.  His
WBC eventually returned to [**Location 213**] but on discharge was slightly
elevated to 13.9.  However, he was afebrile and did not appear
toxic. A CT scan of the abd was done on [**2137-3-25**] and an abdomen
fluid collection at the head of the pancreas was seen and
subsequently tapped by IR and was non-infectious.

T/L/D:  Post-op, he had an NGT, neck JP drain along with an
abdominal JP, a J-tube to gravity and a Foley catheter.  The
neck JP and Foley catheter were eventually removed ([**3-20**] and
[**3-21**], respectively), the NGT was removed [**3-19**].  The abdominal
JP, which had an amylase level of 6600 ([**3-20**]) and the J-tube,
which was used for tubefeeds, remained after discharge.  His
abdominal JP was placed to gravity bag prior to discharge.

Dispo: Physical therapy was consulted and had been working with
patient.  He did well overall except for decreases in oxygen sat
with ambulation.  Therefore, he was recommended to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with
supplemental oxygen after discharge.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post
anterolateral myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous
coronary intervention of left anterior descending artery and
first diagonal artery stenting complicated by apical thrombus
requiring emergent coronary artery bypass grafting with
advanced heart failure and an ejection fraction of 14%.  He
was now admitted for elective right cardiac catheterization
and titration of medications.

Since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 188**] earlier this month, the patient noticed increasing
lower extremity edema and an increase in his weight of over
16 pounds from his ideal body weight of 170 pounds.  He had
been compliant with medications.  He reported that he was
able to walk slowly and climb one flight of stairs since
starting outpatient physical therapy.  He developed dyspnea
and chest tightness with further exertion.  On admission,
vital signs were stable.  The patient was pain free and
without complications.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post anterolateral

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived with his wife in [**Name (NI) **].
He quit alcohol 40 years ago.  He quit smoking 11 years ago
after 50 pack years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
generally comfortable, lying supine in no apparent distress
and nontoxic.  Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of
106/60, a heart rate of 77, a respiratory rate of 16, a
temperature of 98.0??????F and an oxygen saturation of 93% on four
liters by nasal cannula.  The head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination revealed jugular venous pressure to the
jaw at 30 degrees with positive hepatojugular reflux.

The lungs had crackles at the bases bilaterally with a
moderate amount of air movement and no wheezes.  The cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2,
with a positive S3.  There was a II/VI holosystolic murmur at
the left lower sternal border, radiating to the axilla,
consistent with mitral regurgitation and a III/VI
holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border,
increased with inspiration and consistent with tricuspid
regurgitation.  The abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  The extremities had
3 to 4+ lower extremity edema up to the upper thighs, 2+
distal pulses and 2+ femoral pulses.  The neurological
examination was nonfocal.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  The electrocardiogram on admission revealed
an atrioventricularly paced ventricular rate of 75 with no
atrial activity, a regular and wide QRS of 202 ms with
superior access of -70 degrees.  When compared to the study
of [**2176-5-9**], there was no change.

A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2176-5-24**] showed (1) marked
biatrial enlargement, (2) severe left ventricular dilation,
(3) apical kinesis in entire left ventricle with basal
sparing, (4) a large anterior apical aneurysm without
thrombus, (5) severe global right ventricular hypokinesis,
(6) 4+ mitral regurgitation and (7) 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

An exercise tolerance test MIBI on [**2176-5-17**] showed severe
fixed defects of the septum, anterior wall apex and apical
inferior lateral walls.  There was an ejection fraction of
14%.

LABORATORY:  On admission, the patient had a white blood cell
count of 4600, hematocrit of 27.8, hemoglobin of 8.9,
platelet count of 147,000 and MCV of 85.  Prothrombin time
was 13.5, partial thromboplastin time was 27.2 and INR was
1.2.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 143, potassium of 4.6,
chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 18, creatinine of
1.2 and glucose of 16.  The CK on admission was 46.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, [**2176-6-10**], the
patient had a right internal jugular Cordis placed with a
Swan-Ganz catheter floated afterwards.  The right atrial
pressure was 20.  The right ventricular pressure was 55/20.
The pulmonary artery pressure was 55/22.  The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 25 with Vital signs as high as
45.

1.  CARDIAC:  The patient was started on medications
including amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d. and Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.   The patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix throughout his
stay.  The patient's physical examination and Swan-Ganz
catheter numbers were checked twice a day for signs of
improvement from his congestive heart failure.  The patient
was also started on heparin while his Coumadin was held for
anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
started on milrinone on [**2176-6-14**].  This was continued for
two days while his Swan-Ganz catheter numbers improved and
his wedge improved to less than 20.  The patient was also
started on Digoxin at this time.

The patient was aggressively diuresed throughout his stay and
at the time of discharge from the cardiac care unit on
[**2176-6-16**], he had lost 18.5 liters.  His weight at this time
had come down from somewhere around the 180 pound range to a
low of 156 pounds, which was deemed his dry weight.  The
patient was continued on Aldactone, Digoxin, Toprol XL and
Captopril throughout his stay.  The patient was changed from
intravenous Lasix to p.o. Lasix.

The patient was discharged on [**2176-6-18**] with a dry weight of
156 pounds and instructed to page [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 29097**] or M. Nastore for
an increase of weight of two pounds or to page the on-call
cardiology fellow on the weekends.  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for INR checks after heparin was
discontinued and Coumadin started for anticoagulation for his
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was to follow up with the
congestive heart failure clinic in two weeks.

2.  HEME:  The patient had a history of anemia of unclear
etiology.  He was transfused one unit of packed red blood
cells on [**2176-6-14**] for a hematocrit of 28.6 and a goal of 30.
At the time of discharge, the patient had a hematocrit of
35.2, which had been stable for several days.  The patient
will be followed as an outpatient for his anemia.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient had a long standing
history of atrial fibrillation.  He was anticoagulated with
heparin while in the hospital, converted to 5 mg p.o. q.d. of
Coumadin, on which he will be followed for adjustments as an
outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was also put on
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., which he will continue as an
outpatient.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a question of
previous Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
pneumonia.  He was put on precautions for this and had nasal
and anal swabs checked.  These were ending at the time of
discharge.

History of Present Illness:
64 yo female with history of COPD/ respiratory failure s/p
trach, ruptured diverticula s/p surgical repair [**1-20**] who is
normally followed at [**Hospital1 2177**] who was found at [**Hospital3 672**] today
looking cyanotic in asystole.  She was given epi and atropine
down her trach leading to a perfusing rhythm.  En route she
began flexor/ extensor posturing which continued upon arrival in
the ED as well as constant upward gaze.
.
Neurology evaluated the patient in the ED and found bilateral
flexor posturing of the arms and bilateral extensor posturing in
addition to lack of brainstem reflexes.  Their impression was
likely anoxic brain injury, however versed had been administered
and pupillary reactions could be paralyzed by the atroping given
during the arrest.
.
In the ED, saturations were in the high 90's on the vent, with
HR to the 150's and SBP to 230's.  Diltiazem IV (not gtt) was
given for HR with good control in the ED.  Given
vanco/levo/flagyl for possible infection given elevated WBC to
52.0.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Asystolic arrest: most likely [**3-19**] hypoxia from PTX in the
setting of infection and small subsegmental PE.
.
#PTX- Evident on CT and pt w/elevated peak pressures despite
trache.
- Thoracic surgery consulted for chest tube placement. placed
chest tube in right chest in ICU [**2128-3-19**]. removed CT on [**2128-3-22**].
repeat CXR shows no PTX on right. transitioned to previous vent
settings and doing well/ stabilized.
.
#Small subsegmental PE and anticoagulation: She was started on
heparin on HD 1, and then transitioned to coumadin and lovenox.
At this same time, she experienced a HCT drop from 25 to 19 in
the setting of receiving 2L of NS.  She was guiaic negative at
the time, however her CXR showed a new left sided pleural
effusion.  A CT of her chest did not show a large hemothorax and
her LE dopplers were negative for clot.  With these in mind, she
was restarted on coumadin and lovenox and her hematocrit
remained stable over the day.
.
#elevated WBC- probable VAP w as well as UTI (U/A positive
however Urine culture negative); CT abdomen (-) [**2128-3-20**] for acute
intraabdominal pathology. Sputum culture grew acinetobacter
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 36**] to Gentamicin and MSSA.  However since the
patient is MRSA + in her nares, we will continue Vancomycin and
Gentamicin for 5 more days post discharge.
- c diff negative x 3
.
# abdominal pain and obstipation- recent colectomy for ruptured
diverticulae, w/o output from end colostomy since admission-
concerning for torsion of bowel. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis
[**2128-3-20**] showed no acute intraabdominal pathology. However, it did
show distended stomach- g tube placed on gravity per thoracics
recs without improvement in sx.
- surgery consulted: recommend bowel regimen with colace,
mineral oil;
- TF restarted without problem
- aggressive bowel regimen
- guiaic negative stool in colostomy
.
#Poor mental status- improved over hospitalization- thought at
first to be anoxic brain injury. head CT negative for acute
bleed. neuro exam on arrival to ICU was withdrawing to painful
stimuli and minimal corneal and gag reflexes.
per neuro recs- no need for LP at this time
- EEG showed slow and disorganized background, as well as the
bursts of generalized delta slowing; mild-moderate
encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, toxic
metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or ischemia
.
COPD: continue nebs, decrease steroids to 5 q day; goal CO2 on
vent:50-70.
.
Psych meds: restart xanax and seroquel
- seroquel made patient extremely sleepy overnight, with BP in
80's
- decreased qHS dosing
.
Pain- s/p CPR w/exquisite chest tenderness
- cover w/morphine IV
.
#FEN: replete lytes, IVF PRN. given TF at goals
.
Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots, on coumadin and lovenox

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 yo female with hx of afib s/p ablation x2 on amiodarone and
coumadin, CAD, HTN, hyperthyroidism, chronic cough who presents
with cough and SOB. Pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 2953**] for
rapid afib suspectedly due to hyperthyroidism induced by
amiodarone toxicity. She was started on methimazole, prednisone
and metoprolol and completed 2 wks of methimazole but was
continued continued on a prednisone taper although increased
back to 15mg from 10mg due to climbing freeT4. She presented to
her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-13**] for increase in her baseline cough and change in
the quality of her sputum to thick and green but no fever or
chills. He held on antibiotics and obtained a CXR which revealed
blunted CP angles with interstitial prominence but no
infiltrate. This am she noticed irregular pulse so called her
endocrinologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7852**] who consulted with her cardiologist
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and told her to go to the ED. Her irregular pulses
lasted 2 hours and resolved spontaneously before getting to the
ED. She denied CP, CT, PND, orthopnea but did have increasing
DOE. She also reports for the last 2 wks some nocturia with
incontinence, but no frequency, urgency or dysuria during the
day.
In the ED, she was afebrile and VS were stable with CXR
revealing RML opacity so she was given 750mg of levofloxacin,
tessalon pearles and tylenol with codeine and admitted for PNA.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)  Respiratory Failure: Patient was admitted for suspected
pneumonia with positive rhinovirus by bronchoscopy BAL and
presumed bacterial superinfection.  This escalated to ARDS
requiring MICU admission and intubation.   She was treated with
steroids, fluconazole, cefepime/flagyl for a 10 day course.
Shortly after tapering steroids she developed increased
dependence on the ventilator and so steroids were increased.
She was shortly thereafter given a tracheostomy and PEG due to
inability to wean from vent.  Within the first few days she was
improving, able to breath at trach mask only for several hours
per day, however, over [**3-9**]-23 she had increased secretion
and difficulty weaning pressure support with increasing
leukocytosis.  On [**2160-3-10**] she was restarted on Vancomycin and
Cefepime for planned 10 day course.  Sputum has only ever grown
yeast.  As of [**2160-3-15**] she had increased secretions and underwent
another bronchoscopy. This confirmed that the trach was
mechnically intact.
    In review of her respiratory failure, the MICU team also
considered amiodarone toxicity, although seemed unlikely given
acute time frame. She had a bronchoscopy on [**2-19**], PCP was
negative but rhinovirus positive.
Patient was placed on assist-control at night for comfort while
sleeping, and pressure support during the day, and may continue
this at rehab.
.
2) Afib- tachy/brady symdrome:  Followed in house by patient's
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Through course pt had several episodes
of afib/aflutter with additional episodes of RVR with aberrancy.
 Best controlled on Metoprolol 25 mg po BID. Decision was made
to discontinue her amiodarone early in the hospital course as
this was causing hyperthyroidism which was exacerbating her
afib, aflutter. When on smaller doses of metoprolol, pt
developed tachycardia with hypotension and increased work of
breathing.  She had been on digoxin briefly but this was
discontinued in the setting of bradycardic episodes to the 30's.
 Prior to hospitalization she was on coumadin 1 mg po qd.
Patient with heart rate in the 40s intermittently, but remains
hemodynamically stable.
.
She has been maintained well on Metoprolol 25 mg Q6H. When she
does not take her Metoprolol, her heart rate goes into the range
of 130-140. When she is given metoprolol and she is resting, her
heart rate will suddenly decrease dramatically to 30's. She was
asymptomatic with a HR 30s.
.
3) Amiodarone induced secondary hyperthyroidism: Improved to
normal function on steroids.  Endocrine team suggests slow taper
of prednisone and she is currently at prednisone 15 mg po qd.
Goal dose is to get her off of steroids over the next 1-1.5
months. She will need [**Hospital1 **]-weekly TFTs and to follow up with her
outpatient endocrinologist by [**2160-4-13**].  Family can schedule
appointment.
.
4) Hyperglycemkia: Pt required sliding scale regular insulin
while on steroids.
.
5) GERD: cont protonix  and prm reglan
.
6)Tube feeds given through PEG tube.
.
7) Prophylaxis:  Pt does not need heparin SC while INR on
coumadin > 2.0.  She does require a proton pump inhibiotor.

.
8) Access: A PICC line was placed and confirmed by X ray on
[**2160-3-11**], this unfortunattely clotted off and a new PICC was
placed on the left side that is functional.
.
9) Code: Full code - should be re-discussed with patient at
rehab.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58941**] is a 75 year old man with hx of BPH, HTN,
depression and high cholesterol who presented yesterday evening
to [**Hospital6 2561**] with ""inability to speak"".  The history
is very limited because the patient was unable to talk and no
one
accompanied him to the hospital to relay the history.  From
information gathered at [**Hospital3 **], the patient was feeling OK
today until sometime this evening after eating dinner.  Time
course and exact contents of the meal are not known, but he
apparently communicated (in writing) that the food was homemade
and leftovers.  He arrived at [**Hospital3 **] at 7:30-8:00PM.
 Vitals on arrival were: BP 154/86 HR77 RR21 98%on RA.  While
there, could only say one or two words at a time-other details
of
initial exam not documented in available paperwork.  He had a
head CT which was negative.  Around 11:50PM, he vomited and was
given Zofran.  At 1:00AM, he wrote ""please I need help, I think
I'm dying"".  He was reassessed and seen by neurology at some
point.  He repeatedly wrote ""I'm dying"" on paper. He was noted
to
have ""expressive aphasia"" and bilateral ptosis. There was
apparently concern for ""cortical stroke"" vs. toxin ingestion
such
as botulism.  He was then transfered here for further evaluation
and MRI.


Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. Depression
3. BPH
4. High cholesterol

Was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] in [**9-8**] for hyponatremia (?SIADH
from SSRIs) and failure to thrive. At that time he was noted to
have hx of weight loss in the past year of 20-25lbs


Social History:
-lives in [**Hospital1 8**] by himself
-Muslim
-no tobacco or etoh use as per son


Family History:
No known family history of neurologic disease as per son.

Physical Exam:
Gen: Thin, gaunt appearing male, in significant respiratory
distress +accessory muscle use
Neck: supple, no thyromegaly, no bruit
CV: Tachy, regular 2/6SEM
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
aBd: decreased BS soft, nontender
ext: no edema
Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, Oriented to person, place, and
time.  He was unable to speak,though occasionally grunted.
Occasionally mouthed some words.  Tried to communicate with
gestures, very frustrated by inability to communicate.
Comprehension appeared intact-could follow commands, cross
midline.  Unable to repeat or name.  No evidence of apraxia or
neglect. Respiratory distress prohibited further mental status
testing.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2mm
bilaterally.
+blink to threat from both directions.  Eyes were midline and
conjugate on neutral gaze.  +vertical gaze palsy (unable to look
up or down at all), bilateral abducens palsy.  Bilateral ptosis.
Facial diplegia. Hearing grossly intact. Palate elevation
symmetrical. Gag absent. Unable to move tongue, no
fasciculations
observed.

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone slightly increased in lower
extremities.  Occasional fasciculations observed in left quad.
No

Chest CT [**2112-2-11**]:
FINDINGS: The endotracheal and gastric tubes are in satisfactory
position. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar,
or mediastinal lymph nodes. There is a 5-mm rounded density,
which is ill-defined, in the right upper lobe. There are
multiple other smaller ill-defined densities adjacent to this.
There are opacities in both lung apices, which could represent
pleural thickening or scarring. There is patchy air space
disease within the right lower lobe, with endobronchial spread.
There is also airspace disease of the right middle and left
lower lobes. There is calcification of the aortic arch and
descending aorta. The heart, pericardium and great vessels
otherwise are unrmarkable.
The stomach is full of ingested material.
Limited views of the upper abdomen show an unremarkable, liver,
gallbladder, spleen, and upper pole of the kidneys.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
Airspace disease within the left lower lobe, right lower lobe,
and right middle lobes, consistent with infection. Aspiration
cannot be excluded.

EMG [**2112-2-11**]
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are
consistent with a neuromuscular transmission disorder, with
evidence for pre- synaptic dysfunction and widespread fiber
blocking, as seen in botulism.

The differential diagnosis includes other pre-synaptic
neuromuscular
transmission disorders (e.g., [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] myasthenic
syndrome); however, the rapidly progressive clinical picture and
pronounced ophthalmoplegia are atypical for this.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of his weakness.  He was
intubated in the ER for respiratory distress and transferred to
the ICU.  Subsequent blood testing revealed botulism toxin in
his blood.  Approximately 24 hours after admission the patient
received the anti-toxin from the CDC flown in from [**Location (un) 9012**],
[**State 3908**].  Over the course of this admission, the patient
developed a pneumonia that was treated with a 7 day course of
unasyn (although it is likely this pneumonia was more of a
chemical pneumonitis as he was given activated charcoal prior to
admission and may have aspirated).

He also suffered from gastroparesis requiring frequent enemas,
nutritional supplementation with TPN, and an aggressive bowel
regimen.  He was given several doses of neostigmine with the
hopes of improving bowel motility but he did not pass any
significant materail.  He can continue TPN indefinitely until
bowel has fully recovered per nutrition consult.  PICC line
placed on [**2112-2-20**] with tip in the distal SVC.

His ocular weakness has improved in that he is able to move his
eyes from side to side a bit, although still unable to open eyes
(bilateral ptosis).  He remains with good distal extremity
muscle strength in the arms and legs, but poor proximal muscle
strength, unable to lift any extremity off the bed.  He remains
on the ventilator with a trach collar.  He is now being
discharged to rehab, afebrile and in stable condition but
requiring continued aggressive PT.

Note:  He is completely awake and alert and can answer questions
using his hands.  He is unable to open his eyes due to weakness
of his eyelids.  This patient would benefit from speech therapy
and development of creative ways of communication (like pointing
to pictures when he wants to express something he wants, etc.)

He should undergo periodic trials of CPAP and pressure support
vent settings to see if he has regained his ability to breath
without the use of the vent.

He should also have aggressive PT/OT and range of motion
exercises.

CXR: Improving pulmonary edema with a decrease in the size of
the now tiny bilateral pleural effusions. Multiple chronic
compression deformities of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
.
pCXR: Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**4-9**]. Top
normal heart size is stable. Pleural effusion has decreased or
resolved. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. SOB: On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], had signs of volume overload on
CXR (and elevated BNP). Oxygenation much improved after
diuresis. In the ED, she also got steroids/nebs and abx for
?bronchitis. History seems more consistent with flash pulmonary
edema, in the setting of afib with RVR. She may have bronchitis
(no definite inflitrate on CXR) that could have been the
inciting event for afib. Doubt cardiac etiology/ischemia. Ruled
out for MI. Rate controlled with verapamil and amiodarone.
Follow up with cardiologist.
.
2. Afib with RVR: Controlled with verapamil and amio. Cont.
coumadin. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
3. CHF: preserved EF but severe MR (so likely overestimated EF).
Not usually on lasix, so it is likely in setting of afib/rvr.
Diuresed gently with 20 mg po lasix, to complete a week of this
at rehab. Started low dose ACEI.
.
4. Anemia: hct at baseline, slightly lower today but has been
this low in the past. Guaiac stools.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ureteral stent revision

History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old woman with hx of CVA, HTN,
hypothyroidism newly diagnosed Diffuse large B-Cell Non-Hodgkins
Lymphoma who presents with fever, malaise, poor appetite. She
recently underwent exploratory laparotomy with tumor biopsy
[**2146-5-25**] for evaluation of a pelvic mass with placement of
bilaterel ureteral stents. The surgery was complicated by acute
renal failure with creat up to 2.6 from baseline 1.5 suspectedly
due to ATN from ureteral obstruction although renal US revealed
no clear obstruction and she was discharged [**5-29**] with creat
improved to 1.9. She initially was feeling well but over the
next 2 days developed worsening fevers, nausea w/o vomiting and
decreased urine output. She continued to take all of her
medications as prescribed. On the day of admission she developed
a fever to 102 with night sweats on the night prior with
worsening confusion and was brought to the ED. She denied cough,
has mild abdominal discomfort and had no BM. She denies dysuria
but did report some mild bilateral flank pain.
.
In the ED she was found to be in acute on chronic RF with
elevated lactate to 7.6 and positive UA. Abd CT revealed left
sided mild hydronephrosis with no asymmetric stranding and
diffuse lymphomatous involvment of the retroperitoneum extending
up the ureters and involving the renal pelvises as well. Sepsis
line placed and she was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and
flagyl and given 3l NS for hydration with vital signs stable.
She was also evaluated by Ob/gyn who agreed that admission to
ICU for sepsis was appropriate.


Past Medical History:
B-cell NHL- presented with three to four months of appetite
loss, nausea, and back pain.  CT scan performed on [**2146-5-6**]
revealed extensive ascites and peritoneal masses concerning for
ovarian cancer.  Also, noted were bilateral ureteral
irregularities close to obstruction, both on the left and the
right.
CVA- no residual deficit

CT abd/pelvis ([**2146-6-5**]): 1.  Bilateral NU stents.  Left
proximal NU stent is in the proximal left ureter, and there is
associated hydronephrosis.  There is extensive soft tissue
around both ureters, which may reflect extension of the
patient's known lymphoma.  Additionally, there is soft tissue
stranding around the left ureter, and associated forniceal
rupture cannot be excluded. 2.  Extensive soft tissue in the
pelvis, which likely reflects a combination of the uterus, the
known lymphoma, and unopacified loops of bowel, though subacute
hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  The stent position is not well
evaluated without IV contrast.  There is extension into the
retroperitoneum (including around the ureters), and extensive
mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  Tiny foci of air within this, and
also likely small extraluminal air, likely reflect changes
related to prior biopsy and recent surgery.  These findings are
consistent with patient's known lymphoma. 3.  Diverticulosis
without definite diverticulitis. 4.  Small amount of fluid along
the anterior abdominal wall incision. 5.  Foley catheter
positioned within the vagina. 6.  Two pulmonary nodules, largest
measuring 16 mm in the right middle lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with fevers, leukocytosis, acute renal
failure and hypotension. She was felt to have signs of
urosepsis. She was started on broad antibiotic coverage for gram
negative rods in the blood. The etiology of the patient's
urosepsis is likely ureteral obstruction. CT confirmed
hydronephrosis. The patient underwent a failed trial at IR
placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. She successfully
underwent a urologic procedure with re-stenting of the ureters.
The GNR's in the blood speciated to pan-sensitive E. Coli. The
patient's antibiotic regimen was narrowed to ceftriaxone.
Subsequent blood and urine cultures were without growth. The
patient was initiated on solumedrol daily in hopes of shrinking
her abdominal mass. The patient was transferred to the oncology
service for likely chemotherapy.
.
BMT COURSE:
The patient began chemotherapy on [**2146-6-7**]. She received cytoxan,
prednisone, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate. She
tolerated the chemo well. She developed tumor lysis syndrome
which was treated with high rates of IVF and diuresis to keep
her urine output up. She did not develop complications, and
tumor lysis resolved.
.
She continued to have hematuria, the etiology of which was felt
to be ureteral irritation by both the tumor mass and the several
urologic procedures for stenting of her occluded ureters. Her
foley catheter was pulled and she diruesed well and urinated
well. Her hematocrit and coagulation studies were normal. She
will be discharged with follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to evaluate for
the need for continued uretheral stenting. Any concerns of
ongoing hematuria can also be addressed to him. A renal
ultrasound was performed on the day prior to discharge to eval
for resolution of hydronephrosis. It showed no evidence for
hydronephrosis.
.
On discharge, her WBC was beginning to drop as expected and she
began GCSF treatment. She was not febrile. She is to see Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1557**] on Monday in follow up.

palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs the patient
was afebrile.  Heart rate 53.  Blood pressure stable.
Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Generally, the patient was a pleasant male in no acute
distress.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx was clear.
Neck examination was supple without JVD or bruits.  Lungs
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac examination was
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel
sounds times four quadrants.  Extremities were without
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurological examination showed
the patient was alert and oriented times three and cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  Pulses carotid
artery and radial arteries were 2+ bilaterally.  Dorsalis
pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse were 1+ bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2159-10-17**] to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for coronary artery bypass grafting
with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, unstable angina,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolemia.

The patient had coronary artery bypass graft times four on
[**2159-10-17**] with left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal, diagonal sequential, saphenous vein graft to
PL under general anesthesia.  The patient had one
mediastinal, on right pleural and one left pleural tube
placed.  Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] with the assistance of
[**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 51700**], M.D. and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], P.A.  On postoperative
day one the patient was on a neo drip at .75, insulin drip of
2 and kept intubated.  The patient had increased chest tube
drainage on the morning of postoperative day one and was
moderately hemodynamically stable and chest x-ray showed
mediastinal left pleural apex hematoma.  He was taken for
reexploration for increased chest tube output and hematoma
left chest.  The patient was taken back to the Operating Room
for bleeding and upon reexploration clot in the left pleural
space was found and left internal mammary coronary artery
side branch was found to have mild bleeding.  The patient was
then taken back to the cardiac surgery recovery unit.  On
postoperative day two the patient was started on gentle
diuresis and was on a neo drip of .13 with moderate output of
chest tube.  Chest tubes were discontinued and he was weaned
to extubated.

Physical therapy began evaluating the patient on
postoperative day and continued to evaluate the patient
throughout hospital course.  On postoperative day number
three the patient was neurologically intact and the patient
had a bout of atrial fibrillation where Lopressor dose was
increased from 50 b.i.d. to 75 b.i.d.  Chest tubes were
discontinued and the patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four.  After the patient continued
to be in and out of atrial fibrillation and Lopressor was
increased to 100 b.i.d. on postoperative day four.  Heart
rate continued to be 102 on postoperative day five on the
floor and frequency of Lopressor was increased to t.i.d.
Blood sugars were also noted to be increased and [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted for sugar management.  The patient had a bout of
rapid atrial fibrillation on [**2159-10-22**] 120s to 130s,
20 mg of intravenous Lopressor was pushed.  Blood pressure
remained stable at 130/50 and heart rate controlled to 110 to
120.  Dose of Cozaar 25 mg given po.  The patient was stated
on a home dose of Cozaar, however, the patient remained
asymptomatic throughout course. 150 mg of Amiodarone bolus
was given and 400 mg po of Amiodarone b.i.d.  The patient was
started on 400 mg of Amiodarone po b.i.d.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm on postoperative day five and
Amiodarone was continued.

On postoperative day six the patient continued to do well,
however, on the night of postoperative day six the patient
went into a bout of rapid atrial fibrillation again with a
rate of 120s, stable blood pressure.  The patient was given
20 mg of intravenous Lopressor with 100 mg of Atenolol po.
He was rate controlled at 85 to 90.  The patient began a
heparin drip and anticoagulation with cardiology consulting
and following.  On [**10-25**] postoperative day number
seven the patient went to radiology for an x-ray, however,
had black out spell where the patient passed out.  An intern
was notified and the rest of the team was notified and the
patient was taken back to the unit for observation of
syncopal episode.  Cardiology was consulted at that time and
recommended TSH check and the patient was then started on
Synthroid 25 micrograms and anticoagulation was then begun
heparin 11 units an hour.  On postoperative day nine the
patient was on Amiodarone 400 t.i.d., Lasix 40 b.i.d.,
Atenolol 75 q.d. and a heparin drip at 1800 units.  Heparin
was decreased on postoperative day nine and Coumadin was
started and the patient was again transferred to the floor.

Heparin was discontinued on postoperative day ten and
Coumadin was continued at 5 mg po q.h.s. with a goal INR of 2
to 2.5.  The patient's INR on this dose was 1.8.  The patient
was discharged on postoperative day twelve to [**Hospital 25576**]
rehabilitation center in good condition and cleared by
physical therapy.  The rehabilitation center is to check INR
and dose Coumadin on [**10-31**] for a goal of 2 to 2.5.
The patient is to receive 5 mg of Coumadin on the night of
the 16th and from then on INR should be checked on Monday,
Wednesday and Fridays.  The patient is also instructed to
follow up with his primary care physician in one to two
weeks, cardiologist in two to three weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in
three or four weeks for follow up appointments.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male s/p fall noted to have bilateral subdural hematomas
(greater on the right), extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, and
left inferior frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The patient
was evaluated by neurosurgery and started on dilantin and taken
to the OR for craniotomy and evacuation of the R subdural
hematoma on HD 2.  That evening the patient was able to move all
his extremities R > L, open his eyes, and follow commands. On HD
3 the patient was extubated and on HD 4 transfered to the floor.
 HD 5 the patient developed respiratory distress and was started
on antibiotics for pneumonia and subsequently transfered back to
the ICU where he was reintubated.   Once there he was noted to
move his left side less than before and a neurology consult was
obtained.  A head MRI demonstrated multiple new infarcted ares
in the right hemisphere and left white matter.  He was also
noted to have intermittent runs of a fib and was started on
amiodorone and beta blocker. On HD 12, a trach was placed. On HD
13 the patient was transfered back to the floor.
On HD 15, the pt developed respiratory distress, and decreased
oxygen sats. He was transferred back to the SICU where he was
stabilized with high-flow oxygen.
He failed a swallow test, a post-pyloric tube was placed. His
C-spine was cleared. On HD 18, his antibiotics were stopped. His
secretions were managed with frequent suctioning. On POD 19, he
was transferred back to the floor.
While awaiting placement on the floor, the pt pulled his
post-pyloric tube several times. On HD 23, he became tachypneic
and febrile to 103. He was restarted on antibiotics (Vancomycin
& zosyn) and he quickly defervesced. His sputum was positive for
MRSA. He will complete a 10 day course of vanc.
On HD 26, he went for PEG placement, and was transfused 2 units
PRBC (h/o myelodysplastic syndrome) both of which he tolerated
well. His tube feeds were restarted the next day, he was
switched to PO meds and he was transferred to an extended care
facility for further rehab.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year-old
male with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction in [**2155**] and transition cel carcinoma of the left
ureter status post left ureterectomy and colon cancer,
prostate cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient was found to have a right renal mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for right colectomy, left
distal ureterectomy, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral
vascular disease, colon cancer, resected rectal CA and right
carotid bruits and myocardial infarction.  The patient's
preop ejection fraction was 55%.

ALLERGIES:  Intravenous contrast anaphylactic allergic
reaction.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, atenolol, Lipitor, Lasix, Trazodone,
Klonopin and Humulin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to the
Operating Room on [**2163-3-7**] and underwent a right
nephrectoureterectomy and postoperatively the patient did
well.  The patient was extubated in the Operating Room and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit due to his severe
comorbidities.  The patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number two in stable condition.  However,
the patient got acutely agitated on the night of
postoperative day two and required several doses of Haldol.
An electrocardiogram at the time showed no change from
preoperative electrocardiogram.  The patient was not acutely
hypoxic at the time.  The electrolytes at that time were
normal.  The patient's condition improved with several doses
of Haldol and on postoperative day number three the patient
complained of some shortness of breath.  His cardiac enzymes
were cycled and they were all negative.  All four sets of
troponin was less then .14 and CK was mildly elevated 430.
Cardioloyg Service saw the patient and recommended some
diuresis and some alteration in his medications.

The patient got a VQ scan, which was low probability for PE.
On postoperative day number four and on the same day the
patient's JP drain and nasogastric tube was discontinued.
Epidural was discontinued and the right central line was also
discontinued.  On postoperative day three the patient began
to pass some gas and was started on a regular diet and on
postoperative day number four the patient was tolerating a
regular diet and has been passing gas from below.  The
patient is deemed ready for discharge.

Physical examination prior to discharge, the patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs.  Chest was clear.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Heart was regular rate

Pertinent Results:
[**2114-3-1**] Cardiac Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
CAD.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA were normal. 2.  Left
ventriculography was deferred. 3.  Resting hemodynamics
demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
RVEDP was 25 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 40
mmHg.  There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a
PA pressure of 82/40 mmHg.  Central aortic pressure was
low-normal at 102/75 mmHg.  Cardiac index was low at 1.4
l/min/m2.
[**2114-3-4**] LE U/S: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
[**2114-3-5**] Echo: The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) although intrinsic
function is more depressed given severity of mitral
regurgitation. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
synchronization maging demonstrates no significant left
ventricular dyssynchrony; however cannot exclude since images
were technically suboptimal. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2114-3-12**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. There is
no mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2114-3-5**], a mitral valve ring is now identified with marked
decrease in the severity of mitral regurgitation. The left
atrial and left ventricular cavity sizes are now smaller. The
severity of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is also
reduced. Global left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under medicine/cardiology service for
evaluation of her ICD. She underwent a cardiac cath on [**3-1**]
which revealed clean coronaries with severe pulmonary
hypertension. An LV gram was deferred d/t her increased
Creatinine. She was started on heparin for anticoagulation for
her atrial fibrillation (Coumadin was stopped). She was seen be
EP service for ICD management, as was well as cardiac surgery
for mitral valve repair. She was medically managed over the next
several days and her creatine trended down. During this time she
underwent another echocardiogram which revealed a normal EF with
3+ MR. On [**3-6**] she was taken to the operating room and underwent
a mitral valve repair with LV lead placement (for biventricular
pacing). Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She
initially required some inotropes which were slowly weaned off.
EP service continued to follow patient and interrogate her ICD,
post-operatively she was in atrial fibrillation. Chest tubes
were removed on post-op day two. Beta blockers and diuretics
were started per protocol. She was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight and Lopressor was titrated for maximal
hemodynamics. On post-op day four chest tubes were removed and
Coumadin was started (already started on Heparin). An ACE
inhibitor was added and she was transferred to the telemetry
floor on post-op day seven. She continued to work with the
physical therapy service daily. She was gently diuresed towards
her preoperative weight. Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on [**2114-3-16**]. She will follow-up
with the electrophysiology service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist
and her primary care physician as an outpatient.

History of Present Illness:
History from son-in-law:
-
The pt. is an 86 yr old Burmese-speaking male with a past
medical history of severe Parkinson's Disease and Type II DM who
p/w tachypnea and change in mental status. Per family, over last
2 days pt has had decreased PO intake and yesterday his BG was
in the 40's. Pt was given Ensure and then his BG today was in
400-500s. He has also been having increased sputum production
and cough over last several days but no tachypnea until today.
Denies F/C. He vomitted en route to ED but family denies any
N/V/abd pain/diarrhea prior to that. In the ED, the pt was
responsive to pain only and he was febrile to 102. He had a CXR
showing multifocal pneumonia and he was started on
Levaquin/Flagyl. He had an ABG 7.42/30/68 and lactate of 2.1.
Other labs were notable for WBC of 6.3 w 70 % PMNs and 22%

bag, and AG of 15.
-
On arrival to MICU, pt responds by opening his eyes but does not
speak. He is moving all 4 ext. Per family, this MS is improved
from this AM, but not completely at baseline. At baseline, he
does speak some, but doesn't really walk. His PD has become
severe recently. When admitted previously to NEBH for
dehydration he has had similar change in MS per son-in-law.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course, by problem:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia:  The pt. was found to have a multifocal
pneumonia on admission X-ray, worst in the right lower lobe and
felt to be consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.  He was
placed on levofloxacin and metronidazole.  Blood cultures were
drawn and were negative.  Sputum culture was consistent with
oropharyngeal flora.  He was successfully weaned down in terms
of oxygen requirement during his MICU stay.

2. Encephalopathy:  CT of head on admission negative for acute
bleed; he has evidence of chronic microvascular infarcts which
appear to be unchanged from prior study in '[**18**] at NEBH. As per
family, this change is similar to what has happened before when
admitted for dehydration.  The patient improved significantly
with intravenous fluid rehydration. In addition, he received
antibiotics.  Change in mental status most likely secondary to
dehydration in addition to underlying pneumonia and dehydration.


3. ARF: Was secondary to prerenal azotemia and improved with
intravenous fluid hydration.

4. Parkinson's diease: The pt. was maintained on
carbidopa/levodopa and entacapone.

5.  [**Name (NI) 3674**] The pt was found to have guaiac positive stool. Iron
studies consistent with chronic disease.  As the pt. has a
history of gastric ulcers, he was maintained on a PPI.  He
received one unit of PRBCs while in the MICU. His hematocrit
subsequently remained stable.

6. DMII: Pt. takes amaryl 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] at home now with poor PO
intake. Thus, oral hypoglycemics were held and the pt. was
maintained on a SSI.
.
The patient was transferred to the floor after his oxygen
requirement improved.  His course on the medical floor was as
below, by problem.

# Pneumonia - He was continued on levaquin and flagyl x14 days.
His sputum cultures were consistent with oral flora. He was on
4L oxygen when transferred and at discharge is saturating 98% on
room air.
# Encephalopathy - CT of head was negative for acute bleed - he
has evidence of chronic microvascular infarcts which appear to
be unchanged from prior study in '[**18**] at NEBH. As per family, the
change in his mental status is similar to what has happened
before when admitted for dehydration.  His mental status
improved with antibiotics and IVF but the patient continued to
wax and wane; of particular note, this was significant for
increased A.M. somnolence and rigidity.  An EEG was done to rule
out status epilepticus.  This showed diffuse slowing consistent
with encephalopathy but no evidence of seizure.  Neurology also
recommended an LP and MRI if his mental status was unimproved.
Since he was afebrile the LP was deferred as was the MRI as a
brainstem lesion was also thought to be low on the differential
diagnosis.  His was started on an additional small dose of
Sinemet in the morning, resulting in significant improvement in
his sleep/wake cycle and with mental status improving to
baseline.  His comtan was continued on a t.i.d. basis.
.
# ARF- his creatinine remained stable after leaving the ICU.
.
# Anemia- Guaiac+, microcytic, and has a history of ulcers. He
was maintained on a PPI and his Hct remained stable.  Iron
studies were consistent with chronic disease.  He and his family
should consider an outpatient colonoscopy.
.
# DMII-As profound hypoglycemia and then hyperglycemia with
inconsistent po intake was part of his initial presentation, his
oral hypoglycemics were discontinued and he was maintained on
sliding scale regular insulin.  His fingersticks were labile and
it was difficult to maintain euglycemia.  NPH was added to his
morning insulin regimen.  His po intake is still not consistent
so his sliding scale and NPH may regimen may continue to need
adjustment.
.
# F/E/N: An NGT was placed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and he was maintained on
tube feeds. He passed a video swallow, although was still
thought to be aspiration during the study.  He is now getting
honey liquids and ground solids and his tube feeds have been
discontinued.  He is at significant risk for aspiration and
needs to be fed upright and with careful attention to minimize
this risk.
.
# PPx: He was maintained on SC heparin for DVT propylaxis, PPI
for GI prophylaxis as well as a bowel regimen for constipation

Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old Cambodian
female who has no significant past medical history. She was
found unresponsive at home on [**2173-4-6**]. She was
found to be hypertensive and intubated at the scene and
resuscitated with IV fluid boluses. Prior to this, the
patient had neck swelling for 2 days which occurred in
conjunction with administration of Actos for newly diagnosed
diabetes. Laryngoscopy was performed revealing airway edema.
A CT scan of the chest and neck revealed a goiter with airway
compression. TSH was elevated at 7.13. Neurology workup
including EEG and CT was negative. She was transferred here
for a planned sternotomy with mass resection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, the patient was stable and
intubated. Endocrine was consulted given the patient's
diabetes and hypothyroid state. It was recommended that total
thyroidectomy be performed as well as thyroid hormone
replacement initiated. She was preopped for surgery on [**2173-4-12**]. On [**2173-4-12**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy
and partial sternotomy with right total and left subtotal
thyroidectomy. See operative report for details. The patient
tolerated the procedure well from a hemodynamic standpoint.
However, attempts to re-intubate her at the end with
assistance of  tube changer were unsuccessful using 8.0, 7.5,
7.0 and even a 6.5 endotracheal tube and it was presumed that
the patient had an extrinsic mass or perhaps extrinsic
pathology to the trachea. She was returned to the OR on [**2173-4-14**] for rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement as well
as dilation of tracheal stenosis. At this time, it was noted
that she had diffusely abnormal mucosa of her subglottic
space and significantly narrow tracheal lumen down to the
distal trachea. Biopsies and therapeutic aspiration were
performed. At this time, a 6.5 ET tube was placed without
difficulty. She was transferred back to the ICU for further
management. The pathology showed the patient to have
papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with extrathyroidal
invasion and nodal involvement. At this time, the patient was
found to have nosocomial pneumonia with sputum cultures
positive for Acinetobacter, pan-resistant, as well as
Enterobacter cloacae, pansensitive. ID was consulted and the
patient was started on imipenem and tobramycin at this time.
The patient remained stable and on [**2173-4-16**], returned
to the OR for bronchoscopy with tracheal dilation (balloon
and rigid) with tracheostomy. Postoperatively, chest x-ray
showed that the patient had developed a right pneumothorax,
displacing the right hemidiaphragm and the mediastinum,
collapsing the right lung secondary to barotrauma versus the
tracheal dilation procedure. A right chest tube was placed as
well as her central line was changed over wire and post chest
tube chest x-ray showed marked improvement of the large right
pneumothorax. At this time, it was also noted that the
patient had gram negative rods, specifically Acinetobacter in
her blood cultures, and she was also placed on amikacin. On
[**4-17**], chest x-ray showed near resolution of her right
pneumothorax. Unfortunately, the patient went into atrial
flutter which responded to IV Lopressor. Given her high grade
of bacteremia, a CT sinus was recommended by Infectious
Disease. This showed mucosal thickening of both maxillary
sinuses and opacification of the ethmoid and sphenoid air
cells. No fluid levels were noted. Additionally, there is
opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. At this
time, given her stable, resolved pneumothorax, the chest tube
was placed to water seal. On [**2173-4-18**], her vent was
weaned to CPAP and pressure support which the patient
tolerated well. Her A line sites were changed as well. Over
the following day, the patient was diuresed and tolerated
tracheostomy mask trials for 2-3 hour periods per day.
Endocrine was following and corrected the patient's
hypocalcemia with Calcitriol as well as calcium carbonate.
Her blood sugars were stable and the patient was off the
insulin drip at this point. She was started on NPH and
sliding scale insulin. On [**2173-4-20**], a chest CT was
performed to evaluate for consolidation. Multifocal opacities
in the left lower lobe, right lower lobe and right upper lobe
were concerning for pneumonia. A small right-sided
pneumothorax persisted with the right chest tube in place. On
[**2173-4-22**], the patient remained stable. Her chest tube
was removed and post pull chest x-ray showed no evidence of
pneumothorax. At this point, the patient had been receiving
tube feeds at goal via NG tube. On [**2173-4-23**], a PICC
line was placed and the central line was removed. She was
tolerating tracheostomy mask for 6 hours. Over the next few
days, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was uneventful save for a
fever spike in which blood cultures were negative, sputum
cultures showed persistent Acinetobacter infection and urine
cultures showed yeast. The Foley was changed. On [**2173-4-27**], a bedside swallow was performed to evaluate for the
patient's ability to tolerate p.o. intake. Unfortunately, she
aspirated at this time and failed the swallow exam. ENT was
consulted for evaluation of possible vocal cord paralysis. On
fiberoptic exam, it was noted that the patient had
significant edema and pooling of secretions above her vocal
cords. ENT felt that her ET tube was too big/long to phonate
and cognitive issues were also preventing her from fully
cooperating with the exam. They recommended downsizing her
tracheostomy. Discussions with interventional pulmonology
were initiated regarding having a custom-made T tube made. On
[**2173-4-28**], a Dobhoff tube was placed and plans were made
for a PEG to be placed the following week given the patient's
failure to pass the swallow exam. Over the next few days, the
patient was stable and remained afebrile on Unasyn and
amikacin. She completed her antibiotic course on [**2173-5-1**]. She continued to tolerate her Dobhoff tube feeds. On
[**2173-5-3**], the patient returned to the OR for a flexible
bronchoscopy for tracheal measurements as well as flexible
EGD with insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube. The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned
to the recovery room in stable condition. On [**5-4**], her
tube feeds were resumed and increased to a goal of 50 cc per
hour with fiber at full strength. She tolerated her tube
feeds well. On [**2173-5-5**], a rehab facility accepted the
patient and she was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
Of note, I had no interaction with this patient's care. This
hospital course was dictated from the patient's records only.

None


History of Present Illness:
71 yo woman with metastatic breast cancer to spine, femur p/w
acute dyspnea. Pt was in USOH until this afternoon, when she
developed sudden dyspnea @ 3pm. She was not exerting herself
during this period. She reports sitting in a chair at the time
of onset. Pt's caregiver [**Name (NI) 653**] her daughters. The pt was
hesitant to go to the hospital without her daughters. However,
she became progressively more dyspneic over the next hour and
EMS was called. Of note she had recent admit [**Date range (1) 40693**] for
dyspnea, thought to be [**1-23**] PNA (and a possible aspiration
event), treated with cefpodoxime/flagyl.

eventually spiked to 101.6), BP 180s/110s, hr 120s-140s, rhonchi
on exam, given ntg slx1, started on nitro gtt and given lasix 40
mg iv X1 (UOP 750cc). Pt initially placed on BIPAP, but was
weaned off to a NRB. However, while getting CT, as below, pt
transiently required BIPAP, which was again taken off before
being transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]. Otherwise w/u in the ED
included: EKG ST @128 bpm, lad, twi I, avl, std v4-6. CXR:
Perihilar vascular congestion, cephalization of the pulmonary
vasculature. CTA negative for PE or consolidation, though

[**5-31**] CT Head w/o Contrast:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a hyperdense ill-defined 3.2 x
1.9 cm mass at the right frontovertex that appears to be
extra-axial in location with slight mass effect on the subjacent
cortex and minimal subfalcine herniation (approximately 5 mm of
midline shift). No other intracranial mass is identified.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Known lastname **] matter differentiation is preserved and there is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage or major vascular territorial
infarct. No hydrocephalus. A 1 cm destructive osseous lesion at
the right frontal calvarium is seen (2:11), likely a metastasis.
There is also a well-defined lytic lesion of the left parietal
calvarium, at the vertex (2:26) which may represent a prominent
arachnoid granulation, or could represent metastasis in this
patient with extensive metastatic breast cancer. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:

1. Hyperdense extra-axial mass at the right cranial vertex may
represent dural metastasis or meningioma. There is minimal mass
effect and 5 mm of subfalcine herniation. No evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.

2. Destructive osseous lesion at the right frontal calvarium is
likely a metastatic lesion.

3. Possible metastasis versus prominent arachnoid granulation at
the left parietal vertex.

Findings were conveyed to the ED dashboard at the time of the
exam, and discussed with the MICU team.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Unusual constellation of
findings, as above. Given the known extensive metastatic
disease, including epidural involvement in the lumbar spine, the
right craniovertex extra-axial lesion, which crosses the midline
and may breach the superior sagittal sinus, likely represents a
dural metastasis. However, incidental meningioma remains a
possibility as these may occur with increased frequency in
patients with breast cancer.

The well-defined, scalloped left parietovertex lesion is most
suggestive of an incidental ""giant"" pacchionian (arachnoid)
granulation. The lytic ""punched out"" lesion, in the region of
the right pterion, has a most unusual appearance. This includes
peripheral low-attenuation (measuring negative [**Doctor Last Name **], suggestive of
fat) as well as central stippled calcification or ossification,
with no associated soft tissue component. This could represent
an unrelated hemangioma or, less likely (given the
calcification), epidermoid. However, lytic breast metastasis
with residual bone fragments, remains a concern.

If further evaluation is necessary (unclear, given current
clinical scenario), comparison with any previous cross-sectional
study, as well as MRI (including post-contrast, fat-suppressed
sequences) may be of help.
.
[**5-31**] CTA and CT torso
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest, abdomen
and pelvis was performed prior to and following the
administration of IV contrast (130 cc IV Optiray). Coronal,
sagittal and multiple oblique reformats were performed of the
chest as well as coronal and sagittal reformats of the abdomen
and pelvis.

CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The heart is moderately enlarged with no evidence of pericardial
effusion. There is no evidence of aortic dissection. Large
mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted including a 2 x 2.7
cm pretracheal lymph node (3A:29), and two right hilar lymph
nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm each. The bronchi are patent to the
subsegmental level. Diffuse perivascular ground-glass
opacification of the lungs is consistent with pulmonary edema.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, measuring simple
fluid density, with associated atelectasis. No definite
consolidations are seen. Geographic airspace opacity along the
left upper lobe is relatively unchanged since [**2128-1-22**] and
consistent with post-radiation changes. No pathologically
enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Multiple enhancing masses are seen within the
liver, new since [**2128-1-22**] and consistent with metastases
from patient's known metastatic breast cancer. The largest
lesions include a 3 x 2.5 cm lesion in the right lobe (3B:107).
A 2.7 x 2.5 cm lesion of the inferior and posterior aspect of
the right lobe (3B:123) and an ill-defined 3 x 3 cm lesion in
the inferior aspect of the left lobe (3B:116). The adrenal
glands are thickened bilaterally, increased since [**2128-1-22**],
also concerning for metastases. The spleen, pancreas and
gallbladder are unremarkable. A non-enhancing exophytic cyst of
the left kidney is again noted. The kidneys enhance and excrete
contrast normally. The aorta is of normal caliber throughout.
Intra- abdominal small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.
Increased stranding within the mesentery and soft tissues
consistent with anasarca. Duodenal diverticulum is again noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS: The patient is status post sigmoid resection.
Post-surgical changes of the anastomotic site are stable with no
extraluminal air identified. This area is not well distended to
evaluate for recurrence. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy within
the pelvis. Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.

BONE WINDOWS: Again seen are diffuse sclerotic metastases
throughout the lumbar spine and pelvis with a stable L1
compression fracture status post vertebroplasty.

Multiplanar reformats confirm the above findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Increasing mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy.
4. Stable radiation changes in the left upper lobe.
5. Progression of disease with new liver metastases and
bilateral adrenal enlargement suggestive of metastasis.
6. Diffuse osseous metastases with no evidence of new fractures.
7. Anasarca.
.
[**5-31**] CXR
FINDINGS: The patient is in lordotic and slightly leftward
rotated position. A right central venous catheter is identified
with tip overlying the expected region of the distal SVC. There
is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature which may be
consistent with mild pulmonary edema. There is a stable
appearing dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine. There is a
right-sided pleural effusion which is unchanged in size. There
is no evidence of a right pleural effusion. The sclerotic
appearance of several lower thoracic vertebral body is stable
corresponding to sclerotic metastasis on prior studies.

IMPRESSION:
1. Perihilar congestion and cephalization of the pulmonary
vasculature consistent with congestive heart failure.
2. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with
either effusion or atelectasis and is stable.
3. Again identified is sclerotic foci and vertebroplasty
material from patient's known metastatic disease to the spine.
.
[**6-1**] CXR
Moderately severe pulmonary edema and small-to-moderate pleural
effusions, right greater than left, have increased since [**5-31**]. Mild cardiac enlargement has increased. Tip of the right
subclavian line projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.
.
[**6-2**] MRI Brain
HEAD MRI

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1, T2, diffusion-weighted, and
post-gadolinium sequences were obtained.

FINDINGS: An 8 x 9 mm ring-enhancing lesion is present within
the right occipital lobe with an adjacent 9 x 10 mm more
homogeneously enhancing lesion within the left occipital lobe,
both consistent with metastatic disease. Additionally, a
previously identified dural-based mass, predominantly located at
the cranial right-sided vertex with midline extension to involve
the left- sided vertex appears to have mild amount of
homogeneous enhancement in association with thickening of the
dura and dural enhancement, also suggestive of a dural
metastatic lesion. Two osseous lesions, one within the inner
table of the right frontal bone with extension to an extradural
location and the second within the posterior high vertex of the
parietal bone with inner table erosion and adural extension are
also likely consistent with osseous metastatic disease.
Increased T2 and FLAIR signal abnormalities within the cerebral
periventricular deep [**Known lastname **] matter are compatible with chronic
small vessel infarction. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus,
shift of normally midline structures, or acute infarct. No
abnormal areas of restricted diffusion are identified
surrounding the parenchymal lesions. There is mild mucosal
thickening of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, likely
inflammatory in origin.

IMPRESSION:

Findings most consistent with bilateral occipital, subdural, and
osseous right frontal and left parietal metastatic lesions.
Coincident meningiomas accounting for the vertex dural lesions
is an alternative diagnosis.
.
[**6-3**] MRI spine:
FINDINGS: There are areas of low signal identified predominantly
in C2, C4, C5, T1, T2, and T3 vertebral bodies indicative of
sclerotic metastasis. There is no evidence of spinal cord
compression or epidural mass identified. There is no evidence of
intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. Multilevel
degenerative changes are seen from C3-4 to C6-7 without spinal
stenosis.

IMPRESSION: Sclerotic metastatic disease in the visualized
cervical vertebral bodies without epidural mass or spinal cord
compression. No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal
abnormalities.

THORACIC SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images of the thoracic spine were obtained. Comparison was made
with the previous MRI examination of [**2127-6-23**].

FINDINGS: Again diffuse sclerotic metastasis is seen in the
thoracic vertebral bodies. As seen on the previous lumbar spine
MRI of [**2128-3-7**], there is a pathologic fracture of L1 vertebra
visualized with retropulsion. There is mild spinal stenosis seen
at that level.

In the thoracic region at T9 and T10 level, mild epidural soft
tissue changes are seen with mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis.
There is no obvious spinal cord compression seen on the T2 axial
images, however. There is no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord
signal abnormalities seen.

IMPRESSION: Bony metastatic disease with low signal intensities
indicative of sclerosis. Chronic pathologic fracture of L1 with
retropulsion and mild spinal stenosis which appears to be
secondary to epidural disease at T9 and T10 level which can be
better evaluated with gadolinium-enhanced MRI if clinically
indicated. No spinal cord compression seen.
.
[**6-1**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are
normal. There is  focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the
inferior wall. The remaining  segments contract well. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-23**]+) mitral  regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-4-20**], new
regional left  ventricular systolic dysfunction is now seen c/w
CAD and the severity of  mitral regurgitation has increased. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower. A large
left pleural effusion is similar (was present but not reported).


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2127**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings  indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo woman with metastatic breast cancer to spine, femur
p/w acute dyspnea
.
Dyspnea: Pt with evidence of pulmonary edema on exam/imaging,
responsive to nitro gtt in the ED. Elevated bnp. No evidence of
PE despite risk factors. No clear PNA but underlying parenchymal
changes, fever, bandemia. In regards to trigger for flash pulm
edema, CEs positive for NSTEMI with rate related changes on ECG.
No baseline LV dysfunction or valvular disease on recent echo
but new murmur concerning for MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10718**] appeared to occur
in setting of significant HTN, ? related to medication effect
(missed toprolXL, recently started on ritalin).
- Her dyspnea had resolved by discharge.  It appeared to have
been caused by ? flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension and NSTEMI.  Unclear which precipitated which but
her blood pressure was well-controlled on dishcarged and she had
no further episodes while in-house.
.
NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but trending down, at risk for CAD
given left chest wall XRT, h/o hypertension. Not a candidate for
heparin/IIbIIIa inhibitors given CNS pathology. Started on
aspirin, continued on beta blockade, nitro gtt overnight. Nitro
gtt stopped prior to transfer from ICU to OMED.
- she was continued on metoprolol and this was increased w/ goal
HR < 70
- lisinopril was also started prior to d/c
- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30938**] was emailed and she will follow-up with him as an
outpatient
.
HTN: [**Month (only) 116**] have missed her toprol dose on the day of admission.
BP initially controlled with nitro gtt but this was weaned
before she was transferred to OMED and her BP was
well-controlled w/ toprol and the additional of lisinopril.
.
leukocytosis/fever: ? pulm source, no other localizing s/s.
Blood sent/urine sent and negative. Cont levoflox for empiric 7
day course (day 1=[**5-31**]). Also given new MR murmur and indwelling
portacath concern for endocarditis, she had a TTE that was not
concerning for endocarditis although it did show slightly
worsened MR.
.
metastatic breast CA: Recently began treatment with Velban
[**2128-5-7**]. Now with evidence on imaging concerning for mets to
head, new mets to liver and elsewhere in abd. She was given the
news of the spread of her disease and an MRI was performed of
her brain and spine.  She started whole brain radiation  while
inpatient ([**6-3**]) and will continue this as an outpatient per Dr.

Hemodynamically stable. Ambulatory with a walker.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with shortness of breath from pulmonary edema.
 The pulmonary edema was likely caused by high blood pressure, a
small heart attack and worsening of your mitral valve function.
It is very important that you have good blood pressure control
(goal <120/80).  You should also follow a low-fat, low
cholesterol, low-salt diet.
.
Please seek medical attention immediately if you develop fever,
chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain or any
other concerning symptoms.
.
We made some changes to your medicines.
We stopped your Ritalin.
We increased your toprol dose to 25 mg per day.
We added a blood pressure medication call lisinopril to your
regimen.
You will take an antibiotic called levofloxacin for two more
days.
A steroid was added to your regimen for the lesions in your
brain. Please follow the schedule that we have written out for
you on how to take the steroids.
We added a lidoderm patch to your regimen for your pain.
We gave you an inhaler to use when you have shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year-old
male who presented on [**8-23**] with dyspnea despite nebulizers
and O2.  Audible [**Last Name (un) 15883**] was heard and his O2 requirement had
increased over the past two months according to history.  ENT
evaluated the patient and it was determined that a
tracheostomy would be needed.  Importantly the patient has a
history of thyroid cancer with a recurrent thyroid mass
causing restriction of his airway.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Tracheostomy was placed without
complications on [**8-23**].  He did well postoperatively and was
put on Ancef.  He has remained afebrile.  Vital signs stable,
sating well postop day one and postop day two.  The patient
on postop day two starting pureed food with a cough up
without any problems.  [**Name (NI) 227**] this the patient was discharged
on [**8-26**] postop day three given the toleration of his food.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed temperature of 102.8, blood pressure 142/69,
heartrate 81, respiratory rate of 20, oxygen saturation of
100% on room air.  In general this is an ill-appearing male,
thin, lying in a dark room, mildly agitated.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination, positive for photophobia,
no rough spots.  His fundi were sharp.  Mucous membranes were
slightly dry.  Oropharynx was clear otherwise.  Neck showed
no lymphadenopathy, no jugulovenous distension, but positive
for stiffness and pain with active and passive motion.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination:  Tachycardiac with a normal S1 and S2 and a
II/VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Abdominal examination, soft with mild right upper quadrant
and mid epigastric tenderness to palpation.  The tip of his
liver can be felt 3 cm below the costal margin.  There is no
palpable splenomegaly on examination.  Extremities, right
shoulder without erythema or effusion but tenderness to
palpation over the acromioclavicular joint, range of motion
is extremely limited secondary to pain.  There is pain with
active and passive movement.  The patient also has track
marks bilaterally in his arms, no gangway lesions or Osler
nodes present.  The patient has 2+ dorsalis pedis and radial
pulses.  Skin examination:  No rashes noted.  Neurological
examination:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Strength
is [**4-23**] in the upper and lower extremities.  Toes are
downgoing.  Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.  Finger-nose-finger
within normal limits.  Sensation intact to light touch
throughout.  Back, positive for lumbar spine and paraspinal
tenderness to palpation with no masses and no costovertebral
angle tenderness.  Rectal examination, normal tone and
sensation.  Neck, no Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data on admission
revealed white blood cell count of 10.4 with neutrophils
predominant to 82.1%, hematocrit 42.5, platelets 108.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrates, 100 protein, trace
ketones, small bilirubin, 2 urobilinogens, 0 to 2 red blood
cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells, and occasional bacteria.
Cerebrospinal fluid showed no white blood cells, no red blood
cells, protein 32, glucose 72, gram stain negative for PMNs
and negative for organisms.  Chem-7 sodium 139, potassium
4.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate of 23, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7
and glucose 112.  Urine toxicology screen was positive for
opiates but negative for cocaine.  Serum toxicology screen
was negative for alcohol, negative for aspirin, negative for
benzodiazepines and negative for tricyclics.  An magnetic
resonance imaging of the lumbar spine shows no abscess.  Head
computerized tomography scan showed no bleed, no mass effect,
no acute infarct.  Plain films of the shoulder showed no
fracture, no dislocation and no bony destruction suggestive
of osteomyelitis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Infectious disease - The patient was
admitted with fevers to 104.  Initially there was concern for
an epidural abscess with the patient's history of intravenous
drug use as well as lower back pain.  The magnetic resonance
imaging scan of the lumbar spine showed no abscess.  There
was also concern for meningitis with the patient's history of
headaches, photophobia and neck stiffness.  Cerebrospinal
fluid was normal and sterile.  Multiple blood cultures were
obtained and the patient was eventually diagnosed with
Oxacillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.  At
this time of this dictation 19 out of 21 blood cultures were
growing Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Both a
transthoracic echocardiogram and a transesophageal
echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis but this
does not completely rule out endocarditis.

On hospital day #3 the patient also developed a left forearm
abscess.  The patient states that this is the site where he
had previously shot up but accidentally missed the vein.
Ultrasound was performed on the abscess and it was aspirated.
The left forearm abscess grew Streptococcus milleri and
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  An incision and
drainage was also performed by General Surgery on [**9-7**].  Infectious disease consult was sought to help with
antibiotic choice and to help determine the length of
treatment.  The patient had been on Vancomycin since
admission.  He had initially been placed on Vancomycin in the
Emergency Department.  The patient had not been placed on
Oxacillin due to a Penicillin allergy.  Infectious disease
consult recommended adding Gentamicin for synergy.  They also
recommended Oxacillin-sensitive bacteriocidal.  Analogy
consult was obtained to see if the patient was truly allergic
to Penicillin.  Tests performed showed that the patient did
have a true Penicillin allergy.  Infectious disease consult
felt very strongly that the patient needed to be on Oxacillin
in addition to Gentamicin.  Arrangements were made to
transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for Oxacillin
desensitization.  The remainder of the patient's workup was
negative including human immunodeficiency virus, urine
culture, abdominal computerized tomography scan and chest
computerized tomography scan.  At the time of this dictation,
it is believed that the possible sources of his
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia could
either be endocarditis or this right forearm abscess causing
endovascular infection.

2.  Right shoulder pain - The patient had right shoulder pain
on admission.  An orthopedics consult was sought in the
Emergency Department.  Orthopedics was unable to tap the
acromioclavicular joint.  Upon transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] service,
the patient's right shoulder pain improved, however, on
hospital day #3 the patient's right shoulder pain worsened
severely.  Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder
showed small acromioclavicular joint fluid with synovial
enhancement.  Interventional radiology attempted to tap the
acromioclavicular joint fluid with the use of ultrasound but
they were also unsuccessful.  There was concern for aseptic
joint even though the joint did not look erythematous or
warm.  Gonorrhea and chlamydia urine tests were negative.
Infectious disease consult was very concerned about
polymyositis due to the pain out of proportion to physical
examination.  An magnetic resonance imaging scan of the
muscles surrounding the shoulder were obtained.  There was no
evidence of osteomyelitis, diskitis or pre or paravertebral
soft tissue abscess.  There was no evidence of epidural
collection.  The patient was treated symptomatically with
Percocet which helped control his pain.  Due to concern for
frozen shoulder a physical therapy consult was ordered to
provide range of motion exercises.  At the time of this
dictation, the patient continues to have right shoulder pain
only with movement.

3.  Allergy - The patient is allergic to Penicillin, however,
infectious disease felt very strongly that he needed to be on
Oxacillin to eradicate Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus from his bloodstream.  An allergy consult was
obtained.  Initial tests showed that he had a true Penicillin
allergy.  Plans were made for Oxacillin desensitization.
This required a transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit
where he can be more closely monitored.  The patient waited
for a Medicine Intensive Care Unit bed for two days but was
finally able to be transferred to the Medicine Intensive Care
Unit at the time of this dictation.

4.  Left forearm abscess - The patient had no left forearm
swelling on presentation.  However, several days into the
hospital course the patient started to develop left forearm
swelling.  The patient states that this is the location where
he previously shot up but missed the vein.  Ultrasound was
performed of the left forearm swelling.  It showed an
irregular fluid collection measuring 3.2 by 1.0 by 2.0 cm.
There was no vascular flow identified in the collection.
Interventional Radiology drained 4 cc of murky yellow fluid
from the abscess.  It was sent for gram stain and cultures.
Eventually the aspirate from the left forearm grew
Streptococcus milleri, Staphylococcus aureus coagulase
positive, and gram positive rods.  It is believed that the
left forearm abscess could be one of the sources of his
bacteremia.  General surgery consult was obtained to perform
an incision and drainage which was eventually done on
[**9-7**].

5.  Abdominal pain - The patient presented with right upper
quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain.  The abdominal pain
is most likely due to heroin withdrawal since it improved
within a few days after admission.  Workup for the abdominal
pain was otherwise negative.  Abdominal ultrasound and
abdominal computerized tomography scan were negative except
for gallbladder thickening.  Cytomegalovirus IgM,
Ebstein-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus IgM, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency
virus and stool studies were all negative.  HGV was not
detectable by PCR.

6.  Thrombocytopenia - The patient was found to have
splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound.  This is the most
likely cause of his thrombocytopenia.  Human immunodeficiency
virus was also tested and found to be negative.  His
platelets had remained stable up until the time of this
dictation.

7.  Heroin withdrawal - The patient was started on Methadone
at 20 mg on admission.  An Addiction Services consult was
requested.  They recommended decreasing Methadone by 5 mg
each day.  The patient was also treated symptomatically with
Methocarbamol for muscle pain, Quinine for leg cramps,
Dicyclomine for intestinal cramps, Lorazepam for insomnia,
Ibuprofen for pain, and Phenergan for nausea and vomiting.
During withdrawal the patient mainly complained of abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient had very
minimal rhinorrhea.  He also did not have pinpoint pupils on
admission or throughout the remainder of the hospital stay to
the time of this dictation.

8.  Alcohol withdrawal - The patient states that he has a
prior history of heavy alcohol abuse but recently has been
drinking less.  The patient states that he had been drinking
about six beers per day prior to admission.  The patient was
started on a CIWA scale but the patient did not require any
Valium.

9.  Chest pain - The patient was admitted with substernal
chest pain which had been longstanding and eventually
resolved on its own.  On the morning of [**9-9**], he had
an episode of severe chest pain which he characterized as 10
out of 10 in severity.  Electrocardiogram was repeated and
was found to be normal.  The patient was treated
symptomatically with Maalox and sublingual Nitroglycerin as
well as Ibuprofen and the chest pain eventually resolved.
One troponin T was drawn which was less than 0.01.  Due to
the patient's young age as well as normal electrocardiogram
and recently normal echocardiogram the likelihood of cardiac
ischemic chest pain is low.  On physical examination the
chest pain is more consistent with a pleuritic chest pain.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, discharge
diagnosis and discharge medications will be dictated at a
later time.  At the time of this dictation the patient was
transferred from the [**Hospital1 **] to the Intensive Care Unit for
Oxacillin desensitization.

Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]                 Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 9302**]

Admission Date:  [**2181-9-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2181-9-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2149-10-1**]     Sex:  M

Service:  .

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the discharge summary
dictated on [**2181-9-9**].

The patient decided to leave against medical advice on
[**2181-9-30**].

HOSPITAL COURSE (continued):
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient presented with a fever to
104.0 F., on admission.  He was found to have Methicillin
sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.  Blood cultures
remained positive after approximately one week of Vancomycin
and Gentamicin.  At the time of the last dictation, any
localized source of bacteremia was uncertain, given negative
transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal
echocardiogram, abdominal and chest CT scan, urine cultures,
head CT scan and lumbar puncture.

It was thought that the most likely sources were endocarditis
missed by previous echocardiogram or endovascular infection
secondary to the left forearm abscess the patient developed
on hospital day three at the site of previous drug injection.


Given persistent bacteremia, Infectious Disease felt that
Oxacillin would be superior as it is bactericidal.  Because
of the patient's penicillin allergy, he was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for Oxacillin
desensitization, which was performed without incident.

The patient was started on full dose Oxacillin, 2 grams
intravenously q. four hours, starting on hospital day 8,
[**9-10**].  He was on gentamycin for an additional week at a
therapeutic dose, 160 mg intravenous q. eight hours.

While on the new regimen, the patient complained of ongoing
pleuritic chest pain.  A second chest CT scan on hospital day
nine, [**9-11**], showed cavitary lesions in both lungs consistent
with septic emboli.  This finding prompted a repeat TTE on
hospital day 11 which was [**9-13**], which showed vegetation on
the tricuspid valve.

Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted but did not feel that
valve surgery was indicated.  Given the endocarditis,
Infectious Disease recommended a total of six weeks of
intravenous oxacillin therapy.  A PICC line was placed on
hospital day 15, which was [**9-17**].

Liver function tests were measured regularly on oxacillin
therapy and remained within normal limits.  The patient
continued to spike fevers to 101.0 to 102.0 until hospital
day 12 to 13, [**9-14**] until [**9-15**], and then had intermittent
low grade fevers around 99.0 F.; he was afebrile in the few
days prior to his discharge.

The patient's last positive blood cultures was on hospital
day eight which was [**9-10**].  He developed petechiae on his
lower legs bilaterally on hospital day 16 which was [**9-18**],
but at no time were Osler's nodes, [**Last Name (un) 9303**] lesions, [**Doctor Last Name **]
spots, conjunctival hemorrhages or other stigmata noted.  The
patient's white blood cell count remained elevated throughout
his stay and was 12.8 on the day of discharge.  The
leukocytosis and low grade fevers in the absence of
bacteremia were thought to be in response to a evolving
septic lesions in the patient's lungs.

The patient decided to leave the hospital against medical
advice after receiving only three weeks of intravenous
oxacillin.  Since he left against medical advice his PICC
line was discontinued.  The risks of partially treated
endocarditis were discussed with the patient at great lengths
and he was judged by Psychiatry to have capacity to make the
decision to leave.

He was discharged on p.o. Linezolid with the understanding
that this was not the standard of care for Staphylococcus
aureus endocarditis.  P.o. dicloxacillin was not chosen due
to the risk of anaphylaxis, if the patient should miss a dose
of the medication at home.

CHEST PAIN:  Since the time of the last dictation, the
patient complained of persistent left sided pleuritic chest
pain.  He had tenderness to palpation over the left anterior
chest.  This pain was explained by the chest CT scan showing
septic pulmonary emboli, many abutting the surface of the
lungs.

For pain relief, the patient was initially placed on a
fentanyl patch at 50 micrograms per hour with intravenous
morphine for breakthrough pain.

On hospital day 20, [**9-22**], the patient began a three day
course of intravenous Toradol which gave him additional pain
relief.  At the patient's request, we weaned the intravenous
morphine and he was continued on the fentanyl patch and
p.r.n. oxycodone.  Over the course of his stay, the pain
improved and the patient requested oxycodone less and less
frequently.  The patient was discharged with a prescription
for the Fentanyl patch at 25 micrograms per hour to avoid
withdrawal.

As an outpatient, he will need assistance in weaning the
Fentanyl so as not to precipitate withdrawal.

RIGHT SHOULDER PAIN:  The patient had right shoulder pain on
admission.  Imaging showed small joint fluid with synovial
enhancement.  Attempts to tap the joint were unsuccessful
even with ultrasound guidance.  Repeat MRI of the shoulder
region was negative for osteomyelitis, diskitis, pre or
paravertebral soft tissue abscess or epidural collection.

Since the last dictation, the patient's shoulder pain has
been minimal.  He has had slightly decreased range of motion
but no tenderness to palpation, swelling, erythema or other
signs of infection.

LEFT FOREARM ABSCESS:  The patient developed a left forearm
abscess on hospital day three in the location where he
previously shot up but missed the vein.  Since the incision
and drainage procedure by surgery on [**9-7**] there were no
signs of abscess recurrence.  The incision site was clean,
dry and intact and continued to heal well throughout his
stay.

ALLERGIES:  As the patient was shown to have an allergy to
penicillin, he had been transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for oxacillin desensitization which was completed
without incident.  The oxacillin desensitization procedure
took place on hospital day seven which was [**9-9**].

Later in his stay, a dose of oxacillin was missed and the
patient was desensitized on hospital day nine which was
[**9-11**].  This was also completed without incident and the
patient received oxacillin on schedule for the remainder of
his stay.

ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Since the last dictation, the patient has
complained of left upper quadrant pain.  This was initially
concerning for splenic involvement, infarction or septic
embolus.  We attempted to obtain an abdominal CT scan but the
patient refused to drink oral contrast.  In any case, on
examination, it became apparent that the discomfort was due
to left sided pleuritic pain rather than frank abdominal
pain.  The pain resolved over the course of his stay and the
patient was free of abdominal pain on the day of discharge.

HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was thrombocytopenic on admission.
This is likely due to splenomegaly shown on abdominal
ultrasound.  Since the last dictation, the patient's
platelets climbed to supranormal values, likely due to the
role of platelets as an acute phase reactant.  Moreover, the
patient's hematocrit dropped from 42 on admission to 30 to
35.  MCV was 82 to 86.  B12 and folate were not decreased.
Iron studies were most consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.

The white blood cell count was not elevated on admission but
increased to 12 to 18 during his stay.  The white blood cell
count was 12.8 on the day of discharge.  The patient's white
blood cell count will have to monitored regularly on
Linezolid due to potential bone marrow suppression by the
drug.

HEROIN ADDICTION:  The patient had used intravenous heroin
for the past year.  His last use was the day prior to
admission.  Since the last dictation, the methadone taper was
stopped without any signs or symptoms of withdrawal; however,
the patient's pleuritic chest pain became so severe that he
was given a fentanyl patch and intravenous morphine p.r.n.
for breakthrough pain.

The patient asked to be weaned off the intravenous morphine
and made an effort to minimize use of p.r.n. oxycodone.  He
was discharged on the fentanyl patch 25 micrograms per hour
and will need follow-up for pain management.  The patient
showed increasing insight into the role of his drug use in
developing endocarditis and showed motivation to maintain
sobriety.

He would benefit greatly from outpatient addiction services.

RENAL / FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had
no active renal issues on admission.  On hospital day 22,
which was [**9-24**], the patient had an increase in creatinine to
1.3 from a baseline of 0.6 to 0.9.  This increase could have
been secondary to intravascular depletion, BUN was also
slightly elevated, Staphylococcus aureus infection, or an
effect of starting Toradol.  Urinalysis showed 37 white blood
cells and no urine eosinophils.  The urine was examined,
showing bland sediment.

Repeat urinalysis was within normal limits and the patient's
creatinine resolved towards baseline.  At no time did the
patient complain of dysuria, hematuria or flank pain.

DISPOSITION:   Once the patient was afebrile with
consistently negative blood cultures, plans were made to
discharge him to rehabilitation to complete his course of
antibiotics.  The [**Hospital 1238**] Hospital agreed to take him
without insurance.  The patient refused to go to [**Hospital1 1238**].
Considerable effort was made to arrange a way for the patient
to receive his antibiotic therapy at home.

One option was found which required an advance payment that
the patient could not provide.  The patient ultimately
decided that he could not tolerate hospitalization for
another three weeks.  He refused [**Hospital1 1238**] and decided to
leave the hospital against medical advice.

We explained to the patient that his PICC line would have to
be pulled if he left the hospital against medical advice.  We
discussed at length the risks of leaving with partially
treated Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, including
recurrence of bacteremia, receding of the heart valves,
further embolization, or death.  Every effort was made to
convince the patient to go to [**Hospital1 1238**] to complete his
treatment.

On the day of discharge, the patient was seen by Psychiatry
who determined that he had capacity to make the decision to
leave.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   The patient left against medical
advice.  He was afebrile and other vital signs were stable.
He had only completed three weeks of a six week course of
intravenous oxacillin for Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus tricuspid valve endocarditis.

He understood the risks of leaving the hospital against
medical advice and had been assessed by Psychiatry as capable
of making this decision to leave.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient left against medical advice
to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus tricuspid
valve endocarditis.
2.  Septic pulmonary emboli.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Fentanyl patch 25 micrograms per hour, q. 72 hours.
2.  Linezolid 600 mg p.o. twice a day.

The patient was given three days worth of Linezolid and a
prescription to pick up the remainder of a three week course
as well as the fentanyl patch from the Procare Pharmacy at
[**Hospital1 536**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2181-10-11**], at 02:00 p.m.
2.  He will follow-up with [**Name6 (MD) 1748**] [**Name8 (MD) 9304**], M.D., in the
Infectious Disease Department at [**Hospital1 4242**].
3.  He will be taking Linezolid 600 mg twice a day for three
weeks.  He will need regular white blood cell count checks
due to possible bone marrow suppression on this medication.

It is recommended that the patient be assisted in arranging
outpatient psychiatric / addiction services.

RUQ U/S [**5-30**]: Gallbladder wall edema, without gallstones.  No
biliary ductal dilatation.  Given the patient's underlying renal
failure, as well as clinical status of being afebrile and
without an elevated white count.  This could be due to third
spacing.  However, if clinically indicated, a HIDA scan should
be performed, as acute cholecystitis cannot be excluded given
these findings.
.
CXR [**5-30**]: Mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of congestive heart
failure.
.
EKG: NSR, RBBB pattern, no dynamic ST segment changes, flat TW

Brief Hospital Course:
44 y/o female with h/o HTN who p/w headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath w/ pressure 270s/120s. Pt. received nipride
and lopressor. Now CP free. HA free.
.
1. Hypertensive Emergency: Due to poor med compliance. Has h/o
of repeated admissions for med non-compliance per PCP and other
[**Name9 (PRE) **] admit notes. Signs of CNS, renal, cardiac involvement with
microvascular changes notes, CRI, and mild LVH respectively. No
focal neurological deficits noted. The patient was controlled
with PO meds: amlodipine 10mg po qd, labetolol 600mg po bid, and
terazosin 6mg po bid. She continued to be slightly hypertensive
prior to starting hemodialysis because am meds held until after
HD. Subsequently, BP meds were given prior to HD and her BP
improved. She was maintained on the above 3 drug regimen for her
HTN while in the hospital and was discharged home that same
regimen. Further management and modification of her BP will be
done as an OP via her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 3003**] to discharge, she was given one
final dose of her BP meds and told to resume her daily regimen
the day after discharge.
.
2. CKD: CKD with ARF secondary to hypertensive emergency with
poor PO intake, volume overloaded on CXR after hydration, with
hyperphosphatemia. The patient had a tunneled catheter placed on
[**2143-6-3**] and was started on hemodialysis the same day. She
received three sessions of HD from [**2143-6-3**] to [**2143-6-5**]. She was
given zemplar for an elevated PTH (440) during HD and also epo
during HD. She was started on fosrenol 500mg oral [**Hospital1 **]. Magnesium
containing compounds (such as Maalox) were avoided during her
hospital stay. After discharge, she will continue to follow with
her nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28606**], at [**Last Name (un) **], and be on a T, TH, Sat
HD schedule.

Date of Birth:   [**2101-2-9**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 52-year-old man, with coronary
artery disease status post one-vessel CABG, MVR, congestive
heart failure with EF 20-25%, who presents with increased
dyspnea on exertion worsened over the last 2 days.  He also
reports increase in fatigue and anorexia over the last month
with approximately a 10 pound weight loss.  He initially
describes the shortness of breath as intermittent and
occurring over the last month, however significantly worsened
over the last few days.  He denies ever having any chest
pain.  He was evaluated by his primary cardiologist and
electively admitted for right heart cath.

On [**2153-3-29**], the patient underwent right heart
catheterization which showed cardiac output 4.13, cardiac
index 2.33, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 46, PA
pressure 73/27.  Left heart catheterization was also
performed which showed widely patent LIMA to LAD with normal
left main, occluded midvessel LAD, midvessel 30% left
circumflex lesion, and luminal irregularities in the RCA.

After the cardiac catheterization, he was admitted to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for tailored CHF management.
Secondary to sedation received in the Cardiac Cath Lab and
increasing hypercapnia, the patient was electively intubated
on [**2153-3-29**].

The patient was extubated on [**2153-3-30**].  However, due to fever
to 103, right lower lobe infiltrate and respiratory distress,
he was reintubated.

Over the course of the next 4 days, the patient was diuresed
with Natrecor for a short period of time, as well as
intravenous lasix.  His cardiac output and index
progressively improved to a point where his cardiac output
was roughly 6, and his index was 3.3.  As his CHF management
was felt to be optimized, he was placed no pressure support
ventilation on numerous occasions and was not deemed able to
be weaned from the ventilator.  He was, therefore,
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
respiratory management and possible tracheostomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure with EF of 20-25%.
2. Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2132**],
one-vessel, LIMA to LAD.
3. Status post mitral valve repair x 2 in [**2132**] and [**2143**], with
his last MVR being a St. Jude valve secondary to significant
staph endocarditis.
4. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
5. Type 2 diabetes.
6. Duodenal ulcer with history of upper GI bleed.
7. Endocarditis complicated by septic emboli.
8. Restrictive lung disease thought secondary to ankylosing
spondylitis.  PFTs in [**2142**] showed an FEV1 of 1.62, FVC 2.51.
PFTs repeated in [**2144**] showed similar FEV1 to FVC ratio with a
total lung capacity of 48%.  PFTs in [**2151**] similarly showed an
FEV1 of 1.39 and FVC of 1.56.
9. History of varicose veins.
10.Clinically diagnosed ankylosing spondylitis, however no
official diagnosis.
11.History of brain abscesses secondary to septic emboli from
endocarditis.
12.History of gout.
13.History of left lower extremity cellulitis, hospitalized
in [**2153-1-25**].

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, as well as other family members with MVR and [**Name (NI) 1291**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No current tobacco or alcohol use.  Remote
smoking history, quit 20 years ago.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg po qd.
2. Carvedilol 6.25 mg po bid.
3. Glyburide 10 mg q am
4. Rosiglitazone 2 mg q am.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT ON [**2153-4-2**] (UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO ADMISSION
NOTE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.):  Temperature 99.3, blood
pressure 91/46, heart rate 77-95, pulmonary artery pressure
53/21, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12, CVP 12,
ventilated on assist control 500x10, PEEP of 5, FIO2 30% with
SAO2 of 98-100%.  In general, the patient was intubated and
sedated.
HEENT EXAM:  Pupils were equal, round and reactive.  Sclerae
were anicteric.  ET tube and OG tube were in place.
NECK:  Demonstrated a right internal jugular Cordis which was
in place which was clean, dry and intact.  There was a
hematoma tracking into the right scapular area secondary to
traumatic line placement.
THORAX:  Demonstrated limited chest wall movement with
inspiration.  Bilateral rhonchi were noted.  There was a
question of paradoxical movement of the chest wall.
CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION:  An irregularly irregular heart
rate, loud metallic S2, with a III/VI systolic murmur
diffusely across the precordium.
ABDOMEN:  Tense but there was no rebound or guarding.
Normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Showed chronic venous stasis changes bilateral
lower extremities, but there was no edema on exam.  He had
decreased peripheral pulses bilaterally, which have been
noted to be dopplerable in the past.
SKIN:  Demonstrated no other rashes or skin breakdown.  There
were no sacral decubitus ulcers.
NEURO EXAM:  He was awake and alert, and he was following
commands appropriately once sedation was weaned.

LABORATORY VALUES ON [**2153-4-2**]:  White count 12.0 with normal
differential, hematocrit at baseline 39 which decreased to
29, platelets 108, MCV 89, PT 12, INR 1.1, PTT 58, sodium
139, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, bicarb 33, BUN 24,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 110, calcium 8.3, phosphorus 3.4,
magnesium 2.3, ALT 14, AST 33, alk phos 62, total bili 1.4,
hemoglobin A1C 9.0.  Blood cultures [**3-30**] and [**2153-4-1**] were
negative.  Sputum culture from [**3-30**] showed 4+ gram-positive
cocci in pairs, chains and clusters.  However, respiratory
culture showed only moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora.

EKG from [**2153-3-27**] on admission showed atrial fibrillation,
poor R wave progression, low voltage, but essentially
unchanged from EKG dated [**2152-8-25**].

PERTINENT RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS DURING HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CT of the abdomen [**2153-3-31**] showed diffuse bibasilar
central lobular and nodular pulmonary opacities likely
consistent with infectious etiology.  Simple cyst within the
right kidney.  No evidence of bowel obstruction, perforation,
or an abscess within the abdomen.
2. Chest x-ray [**2153-4-1**] showed improving right lower lobe
process related to area of resolving aspiration or pneumonia.
3. Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2153-3-28**] showed an EF of 25%,
left atrial enlargement, global left ventricular hypokinesis,
paradoxical septal motion consistent with right ventricular
pressure volume overload, and increased pulmonary
hypertension when compared with transthoracic echocardiogram
performed in [**2152-4-25**].
4. Cardiac catheterization [**2153-3-29**] showed cardiac output
4.13, cardiac index 2.33, PA pressure 73/27, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure mean of 46.  There was a widely
patent LIMA to LAD with the left main showing no
angiographically apparent lesion.  His LAD was occluded
midvessel.  There was a left circumflex midvessel lesion of
approximately 30%.  RCA demonstrated luminal irregularities.

IMPRESSION:  A 52-year-old,with congestive heart failure, EF
of 20-25%, coronary artery disease status post one-vessel
CABG in [**2132**], MVR x 2 complicated, first one complicated by
endocarditis with current St. Jude valve, atrial
fibrillation, and restrictive lung disease known to be
present since [**2142**] which is thought secondary to ankylosing
spondylitis, who was transferred from the Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for difficulty
to wean from the ventilator despite optimal diuresis.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient's
initial presenting symptoms included dyspnea on exertion and
shortness of breath for 1 month which increased over the last
2 days.  However, his symptoms also included significant
fatigue, anorexia and a 10-pound weight loss.  Given his
clinical history and chest x-ray findings, he was felt to
have a right lower lobe pneumonia which, in combination with
congestive heart failure, was contributing to his symptoms at
home.  However, postcatheterization on [**2153-3-29**], the patient
was noted to be overly sedated secondary to medications
received in the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, and had an ABG
performed.  The gas at that time showed a pH of 7.12, PCO2
96, PO2 103.  It was unclear what the patient's baseline PCO2
was; however, it was suspected to be elevated given his
history of restrictive lung disease and likely poor
ventilatory ability.

The patient was extubated on [**2153-3-30**] with immediate
postextubation ABG showing pH 7.31, PCO2 74, PO2 154 which,
over the next few hours, worsened to ABG with pH 7.20, PCO2
95, PO2 93.  He was reintubated for hypercapnic respiratory
failure a few hours after initial extubation.  He was tried
on pressure support ventilation over the next 48 hours and
failed multiple weaning trials.  He was, therefore,
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit [**2153-4-2**],
after being intubated 4 days and deemed unable to wean from
the ventilator.

It was the opinion of the Medical Intensive Care Unit team
that the patient's primary respiratory difficulties were
secondary to restrictive lung disease, which acutely worsened
secondary to a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was treated
with intravenous antibiotics for a total of 14 days with
improvement in the right lower lobe pneumonia.  Numerous
trials were performed in hopes of extubating the patient.
However, at the time of this dictation, the patient's RSBI
still remained greater than 100, and he is currently on
pressure support ventilation of 20/5.  He has been weaned
down on numerous occasions to pressure support ventilation of
[**5-30**].  He currently is off all sedation and appears to be
breathing comfortably without signs of respiratory distress.
Of note, his tidal volumes are approximately 200-300 with
respiratory rates in the mid to high 20s.

A VD/VT was performed while still intubated which showed a
percentage greater than 60.  It was likely felt secondary to
the amount of dead space, and that he would be unlikely to
tolerate extubation, and plans were still in place for a
tracheostomy.

Due to his chronic restrictive lung disease, it was felt that
his baseline PCO2 ran in the range of 50-60, and his PO2 was
adequate in the 80-90 range.  His vent settings were titrated
for these goals, and the patient had no apparent respiratory
distress.

2) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 109906**] was initially
admitted with symptoms which appeared to be consistent with
congestive heart failure exacerbation over the last month.
At the time of admission, his pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 46.  He was diuresed appropriately with lasix
and Natrecor down to a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
14.  However, at this time he appeared to be volume deplete,
and he was given intermittent intravenous fluid boluses until
his hemodynamics were optimized.  He appeared to be optimized
with a capillary wedge pressure of approximately 22, and a
CVP in the 12-14 range.  With these settings, his cardiac
output was 6.0, and his cardiac index was 3.3.  His Swan was
pulled on [**2153-4-4**].

Attempts to restart his outpatient CHF management, including
ACE inhibitor and lasix, was attempted.  However, the patient
dropped his pressure to these interventions.  Per his
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], these medications
were placed on hold until he was stable off the ventilator.
He was continued on his digoxin 0.25 mg qd with normal dig
levels maintained.

3) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He was found to have a right lower
lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray, and a sputum culture with
gram-positive cocci, 4+, in pairs and clusters.  It was
assumed that he had a staph pneumonia and was appropriately
treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for plans to complete
a 14-day course.  He received an additional 5 days of
azithromycin at the beginning of his course.  Blood cultures
were performed on 2 separate occasions and found to be no
growth both times.

4) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  On two separate occasions, Mr.
[**Known lastname 109907**] creatinine bumped with diuresis.  Urine
electrolytes were performed, and on each occasion showed
evidence of prerenal physiology.  Lasix was held, and he was
given mild hydration with improvement in creatinine.

5) MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT:  He is status post MVR x 2,
currently with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**], well-seated per transthoracic
echocardiogram [**2153-3-28**].  After cardiac catheterization, he
was maintained on a heparin drip with a goal PTT of
approximately 60-80.  Coumadin is planned to be started after
the patient's tracheostomy.

6) ARRHYTHMIA:  The patient known to be in chronic AFIB.
However, he had a few episodes of NSVT ranging from 10-17
beats while he was on Levophed.  As he was felt to have
nonischemic cardiomyopathy, there was no role for
antiarrhythmic therapy or ICD placement.  Once he was
discontinued from pressor therapy, his NSVT resolved.

7) ANEMIA:  Mr. [**Known lastname 109907**] baseline creatinine is
approximately 39, which dropped to 29 over the first few days
in the Intensive Care Unit.  It was felt that his anemia was
secondary to blood loss, as he had a traumatic right
intrajugular central line placed with surrounding
ecchymoses/hematoma.  He was transfused on several occasions
to maintain his hematocrit above 30.  He tolerated these
transfusions without incident.  His neck hematoma appeared to
be improving at the time of this dictation and it was likely
that his heparin use contributed to this process.

8) RHEUMATOLOGY:  Due to the confusion over the patient's
diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, the rheumatology service
was consulted.  Per their request, an HLA-B27 level was sent
which was found to be negative.  Using this information, they
felt that his most likely diagnosis was DISH and; therefore,
his intercept was discontinued.

9) FEN:  The patient was on tube feeds, ProBalance, at a goal
rate of 65 cc/h while an OG tube was placed.  A PEG tube will
be placed after tracheostomy, and continue tube feeding as
appropriate.

DISPOSITION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 109906**] will remain in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit until tracheostomy is performed, at which
time screening for a pulmonary rehabilitation facility will
take place.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Restrictive lung disease secondary to abnormal chest wall
compliance secondary to diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis (DISH).
2. Respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation.
3. Right lower lobe pneumonia thought secondary to
Staphylococcus aureus.
4. Congestive heart failure, systolic, nonischemic.
5. Acute renal failure, prerenal in etiology.
6. Atrial fibrillation.
7. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
8. Type 2 diabetes.

Service:

This dictation will dictate the course from [**5-20**] until
[**2153-5-27**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old gentleman
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement
times two, history of congestive heart failure who was
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in [**2153-3-26**] with
respiratory distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He has had a prolonged course including
difficulty weaning off of the ventilator, requiring
tracheostomy, requiring a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.  His percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was
complicated by hematoma in his intra-abdominal area and it
was also complicated by renal failure, necessitating dialysis
as well as multiple aspiration pneumonias.

1.  Respiratory failure - On [**2153-5-20**], the patient had
an acute worsening of his respiratory failure with a
temperature of 101.7, respiratory rate in the 40s.  He was
diagnosed with an aspiration pneumonia and [**Location (un) **] sepsis.
He was treated with Ceftazidime, Vancomycin and one dose of
intravenous Gentamicin.  Eventually his gram negative rods
grew out of his sputum which were speciated as Enterobacter
and Pseudomonas.  He was treated initially with Ceptaz,
single coverage and then Levaquin was added to double cover
for Enterobacter.  His respiratory status improved.  He was
able to be weaned off of pressor support and eventually onto
tracheostomy collar.  At the time of discharge, he was
tolerating a trach collar for 12 hours during the day with
resting pressor support [**10-30**] overnight.  The patient will
complete a 14 day course of Ceptaz which will be completed on
[**6-3**], as well as a seven day course of Levaquin which also
be completed on [**6-3**] and the patient will continue to be
weaned off of the ventilator, hopefully achieving trach
collar 24 hours a day.

2.  Hypotension - The patient became hypotensive again on
[**5-21**], thought secondary to pneumonia and sepsis.  He was
initially on pressors, however, we were able to wean off of
the Levophed, and with broad-spectrum antibiotics his blood
pressure improved and he is maintaining MAPs in the 50s and
60s off all of blood pressure medications.

3.  Renal failure - The patient has become
dialysis-dependent, receiving hemodialysis three times a
week.  Currently the plan is to continue to remove fluid as
tolerated.  He will continue his hemodialysis three times a
week.  He will receive Erythropoietin with dialysis per Renal
recommendations.

4.  Abdominal hematoma - The patient initially suffered a
large abdominal hematoma in the setting of percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy placement and anticoagulation.
However, with maintaining the INRs in the 2.5 to 3 range, he
has maintained his hematocrit as stable and he has not had
any further intra-abdominal bleeding.

5.  Mitral valve replacement/atrial fibrillation - The
patient requires anticoagulation for prosthetic valve as well
as atrial fibrillation.  The INR goal is 2.5 to 3.  Currently
he is going to be discharged on Coumadin 3 mg.  Should his
INR drop below 2.5 we need to restart heparin without a
bolus.  Should his INR get above 3, Coumadin needs too be
decreased because he has had large intra-abdominal bleeds in
the setting of INR greater than 3.

6.  Diabetes - The patient is tolerating tube feeds at goal
and subsequently has required insulin requirement.  We are
planning to discharge him on 24 units of Lantus in the
evening, covering with regular insulin sliding scale with
goal fingersticks in the 80 to 140 range.

7.  Nutrition - The patient has been maintained on tube
feeds, Nepro at full strength at 35 cc/hr, through his
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.  Upon further
improvement, he will need a repeat speech and swallow
evaluation to dictate whether or not p.o. foods can be
initiated.

8.  Access - The patient will be discharged with a right PICC
line and a left subclavian hemodialysis catheter.

9.  Prophylaxis - The patient will be discharged on Coumadin
and Lansoprazole proton pump inhibitor.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation where he will undergo further rehabilitation
on the ventilator, hopefully coming off the ventilator full
time as well as physical therapy as well as speech and
swallow therapy to initiate feeding p.o. once again.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft, mitral valve replacement.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20 to
25%.
3.  Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
4.  Prolonged ventilation secondary to congestive heart
failure plus aspiration pneumonia, now status post trach and
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, requiring a prolonged
trach wean.
5.  Restrictive lung disease thought secondary to ankylosing
spondylitis.
6.  Type 2 diabetes, requiring Lantus and sliding scale.
7.  History of gastrointestinal bleed and duodenal ulcer.
8.  Intra-abdominal hematoma secondary to percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy and anticoagulation.
9.  Renal failure, now necessitating hemodialysis.
10. History of gout.
11. History of brain abscesses, secondary to septic emboli
from endocarditis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ceptaz 1 gm dose at dialysis, to be completed on [**6-3**].
2.  Levofloxacin 250 mg q. 24, also to be completed [**6-3**].
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s., INR goal 2.5 to 3.
4.  Lantus 23 units at night, regular insulin sliding scale
as needed.
5.  Lexapro 10 mg q.d.
6.  Digoxin .125 mg q. 3 days, to check periodic Digoxin
level.
7.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg b.i.d.
8.  Erythropoietin 500 intravenously with dialysis.
9.  Reglan 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. intravenously prn.
10. Vitamin C.
11. Zinc.
12. Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers as needed.
13. Prn Oxycodone one q. 6 prn.
14. Ativan 1 mg q.h.s. prn.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with primary care
physician after prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation.

Name: [**Known lastname 18020**], [**Known firstname 126**]        Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 18021**]

Admission Date:[**2153-4-29**]       Discharge Date:[**2153-5-20**]

Date of Birth:                  Sex:

Service:

ADDENDUM:  This is a discharge Addendum from [**2153-4-29**]
until [**2153-5-20**].

The patient is a 52-year-old man with coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral
valve replacement times two, with congestive heart failure,
and interstitial lung disease who had been admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit secondary to respiratory decline.  His
course had been complicated by difficulty weaning off the
ventilator requiring a tracheostomy and as needed assist
control.  The [**Hospital 1325**] hospital course was also complicated
by abdominal bleed times two; most recently in early [**Month (only) **].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE (CONTINUED):

 1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was aggressively
diuresed from [**4-29**] until about [**5-5**].  The patient had
been on a Lasix drip and then occasionally required
intravenous Lasix boluses.  His urine output continued to
drop off, and his creatinine began to increase; consistent
with acute renal failure.

The patient had been initially started on Coreg 3.125 mg
twice daily and lisinopril 2.5 mg once daily was added.  The
patient's blood pressure was tenuous and often required
medications to be held.  He was also maintained on digoxin
0.0625 mg every other day.  This was increased to 0.125 mg
once per day to have a goal digoxin level of 1.6 to 2.
However, he never had any signs or symptoms of digoxin
toxicity.

The patient had been maintained on a Natrecor and Lasix drip.
This was finally discontinued in early [**Month (only) **].  In addition,
dopamine was begun causing sinus tachycardia and dobutamine
which caused some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
However, this was discontinued as the CHF attending
felt this may not be helping his cardiac status.

 2.  RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's creatinine had been
improving to a minimum of 1.7.  He had no chronic renal
insufficiency and apparently has normal renal function
usually.  However, his creatinine started to increase around
[**5-6**] and [**5-7**].

He was assessed by Renal who felt that his acute renal
failure could be secondary to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs, ACE inhibitors, and some acute tubular necrosis.
However, this was complicated by his severe congestive heart
failure and poor forward flow.  He was started on
hemodialysis finally on [**2153-5-12**].  A temporary left
internal jugular hemodialysis catheter was placed, which was
replaced by a long-term catheter on [**5-14**] without
difficulty.

A renal ultrasound was also checked to evaluate for the size
of his kidneys.  The left kidney was 8.8 cm and the right
kidney was 10.5 cm.  This was consistent with possible hope
in improvement of his acute renal failure.  However, he has
not had increased urine output nor has he had improving blood
urea nitrogen or creatinine without dialysis.  He has
undergone dialysis and ultrafiltration for approximately one
week continuously, and he will be transitioned to three times
per week.  In addition, the patient was started on
Nephrocaps.  Lasix, ACE inhibitor, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and other nephrotoxins were avoided.
All of his medications were renally dosed.

 3.  NONSUSTAINED VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:  The patient had
occasional nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with
occasional beats lasting approximately 30 beats.  He was
asymptomatic throughout this.  It was found that his
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was very electrolyte
sensitive, and he usually responded to 20 mg of intravenous
or by mouth potassium.  The patient will eventually need an
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator once he is deemed
medically able.

He was seen by Electrophysiology in late [**Month (only) 880**] who thought
that medications or antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone were
contraindicated secondary to the patient's interstitial lung
disease.  Moreover, lidocaine might be contraindicated
because of his renal disease.

 4.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient continued to have
respiratory failure which was thought to be multifactorial
secondary to congestive heart failure, deconditioning, and
interstitial lung disease.  Through the course of this month,
he has been weaned down to a tracheostomy mask which he has
maintained for up to 96 hours in a row.

However, on [**2153-5-20**] the patient was noted to have
tachypnea and increased sputum and was placed back on the
ventilator for rest.

 5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient required an 11-day
course for Pseudomonas bronchitis versus
ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as Enterococcus in
his blood.  The patient's blood culture was drawn from an
arterial line which was subsequently removed.  The
Enterococcus was ceftazidime sensitive.  As he had become
febrile to 101.7, tachypneic to 40s, tachycardic to 130, and
hypotensive he has been started at this time on cefepime 500
mg q.24h., vancomycin times one, and gentamicin times one
(per Infectious Disease recommendations).  A chest x-ray was
not notable for a new infiltrate.

 6.  HEMATOMA:  The patient had no further bleeding into his
abdomen.  His partial thromboplastin time was maintained
between 50 to 70.  He was kept on his twice per day
hematocrit checks and did occasionally require transfusions
of packed red blood cells.

 7.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was
maintained on tube feeds.  This was changed on the 23rd into
bolus feedings overnight.  However, these bolus feedings were
held on [**2153-5-20**] secondary to nausea and some abdominal
pain.

 8.  HEMATOLOGY:  Heparin has been continued.  Coumadin was
started on [**2153-5-15**] with a goal INR between 2.5 to 3.
Currently, his INR is 1.2.

 9.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient has been seen by Psychiatry
since [**2153-5-2**].  Initially, the patient was deemed not
to have depression and needed no further medications.

However, on [**2153-5-19**] another psychiatrist came onto the
case and recommended Lexapro 5 mg once per day.

10.  ACCESS:  The patient has a right peripherally inserted
central catheter in place.  A left tunnel internal jugular
was placed for hemodialysis.

11.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was placed on Prevacid and
heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.

12.  CODE STATUS:  Full.

13.  DISPOSITION:  The patient currently has a new infection.
Eventually, he will need to go to rehabilitation for further
physical therapy and occupational therapy.

Service:


This dictation is for hospital events between [**2174-5-6**] and
[**2174-6-6**].

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. AML.  Despite a known right lower quadrant infectious
   process and a known gram-negative rod bacteremia, the
   decision was to proceed with the mismatched allogenic bone
   marrow transplant.  Day 0 of her transplant was on [**2174-5-17**].  Please see below for details of the complications
   of her course.

Right lower quadrant abscess/infectious process:  The
Infectious Disease and Surgery team followed throughout her
entire course.  She was treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics including Flagyl, voriconazole, meropenum,
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and at times aztreonam and
gentamicin as well.  For most of her course, she continued to
spike with these antibiotics, and it was believed that this
is the source of her bacteremia, rods in her blood.  She was
followed with serial CAT scans, which overall did not show
significant changes throughout the month.

There was concern that at the time of her reconstitution of
her immune system, that there might be increased inflammation
at this process and that there was a risk of perforation.
Around this time, there was increased pain and she was
followed closely, however, at no time there was indication
for surgical intervention.  Upon recovery of her counts, she
had decreased pain as well as decreased fevers (although she
was on high-dose steroids at this time as well), and hope was
that with an intact immune system, she would avoid the need
for surgical intervention.

Repeat CAT scan on [**2174-6-5**] revealed unchanged size, but
evidence of decreased amount of inflammation.  At the time of
this dictation, she has been treated with Zosyn, aztreonam,
and Flagyl.

1. Gram-negative rod/pseudomonal bacteremia.  Patient with
   multiple positive blood cultures throughout this month
   with growing Pseudomonas, two different isolets.  She
   continued to have positive cultures despite the multiple
   antibiotics listed above.  It was felt that she was
   seeding her blood from the right lower quadrant process.
   Infectious Disease team followed closely, and the positive
   cultures were speciated and at one point, there was
   evidence acquired resistance to meropenum.  There was also
   resistant ciprofloxacin, but sensitive to Zosyn.
   Therefore changed to Zosyn.  At the time of this
   dictation, patient has been afebrile except for one low
   grade temperature for the past few days, although as
   mentioned, has been on a good amount of steroids.  She has
   been followed with surveillance cultures.

1. Pulmonary.  On day 11 status post transplant, patient
   developed respiratory distress.  She had evidence of fluid
   overload on her chest x-ray.  A trial with Lasix was
   unsuccessful causing brief transient hypotension.  Due to
   impending respiratory failure, patient was transferred to
   the ICU and required intubation.  She was intubated on
   [**5-30**].  Treated with high-dose steroids at 200 mg b.i.d.
   Because of this respiratory failure, was felt to be due to
   CHF as echocardiogram revealed a new global hypokinesis,
   an EF of 25 percent plus/minus engraftment syndrome
   causing capillary leak as this occurred in the setting of
   recovery of her counts as well as plus/minus diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage.

For this reason, the patient was diuresed aggressively,
treated with high-dose steroids and transfused to keep her
platelets greater than 50,000 to avoid bleeding.  Patient
responded well to this treatment, and was able to be
extubated on [**6-1**] without event.

Over the next few days with continued weaning of her steroids
and continued diuresis, patient was able to wean to room air.
Currently is breathing comfortably saturating 95 percent on
room air.

1. Cardiac.  As mentioned, a repeat echocardiogram revealed a
   new global hypokinesis with an EF of only 25 percent.
   This is felt to be secondary to her transplant due to
   cytokine release and the feeling that this would recover
   in time.  She was treated with afterload reduction with
   low-dose ACE inhibitor as well as Lasix as needed.  The
   plan is to repeat an echocardiogram later in her course.

1. Renal.  The patient felt acute renal failure going from a
   creatinine of a baseline of 0.4 to a peak of 1.2.  This
   occurred in the setting of a high cyclosporin level as
   well as while being on medications such as AmBisome and
   gentamicin, so was therefore to be multifactorial.  These
   medications were stopped and cyclosporin dose was
   decreased, and patient's creatinine stabilized, and has
   slowly decreased to 1.0, which is still above her
   baseline.

1. Hyperbilirubinemia.  Patient's first major complication
   following transplant was a rapidly rising total bilirubin,
   the majority of which was of the direct fraction.  There
   was never any clear cause discovered for this elevated
   bilirubin.  There was a large concern for [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlusive
   disease as this is a common complication following
   transplant.  For this reason, the patient had serial
   ultrasound studies with Dopplers, which were all normal
   showing no reversal flow in the portal system and no
   evidence of ascites.  The bilirubin peaked at 28 and
   without any specific treatment, began to trend down, and
   at the time of this dictation is currently in the 5's.

1. FEN.  Patient was maintained on TPN and kept NPO except
   for sips.  At the time of this dictation, her diet is
   being advanced to clears as tolerated.

The remainder of this discharge summary including the
discharge diagnoses, discharge medications will be dictated
in the future as part of an addendum to this discharge
summary.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient continued to improve during her
last week in the hospital.

Pulmonary:  With continuing diuresis, the patient's shortness
of breath improved as did her oxygen saturation on room air.
She was able to ambulate without requiring oxygen and with
time improved conditioning, had less shortness of breath
as well.  Additionally since it was felt that some of her
shortness of breath was secondary to CHF, her ACE inhibitor
was slowly titrated with good effect, and she tolerated this
well.

Infectious disease:  Her abdominal pain resolved completely
such that she was no longer tender on exam.  She completed 14
days of Zosyn after her engraftment.  She was also switched from
total parenteral nutrition to p.o. nutrition without nausea,
vomiting, or abdominal pain. She was discharged from the hospital
without TPN.

Renal failure:  Her creatinine continued to improve back
to baseline.

Cardiovascular system:  Repeat echocardiogram showed some
minimal improvement in systolic function with EF of 25-30
percent improved from 20-25 percent.  However, she still had
a  globally  impaired function.   The  lisinopril was titrated
and was well tolerated. Her ongoing  cardiovascular issues will
be addressed as a outpatient.

Hepatic dysfunction: Liver function  continued to improve,
although with the reintroduction of food, the bilirubin
stabilized at  around 4.  This was likely
secondary to mild [**Last Name (un) 6169**]-occlussive disease. However, she had no
right upper quadrant tenderness.  Ursodiol was continued.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.  Ambulating well on room air.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Refractory AML.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 26-year-old female
with progressive AML diagnosed [**3-9**] status post 7 + 3 x2,
most recently [**3-10**] complicated by prolonged aplasia
approximately 32 days with appendicitis/typhlitis, who
represents with 7 + 3 reinduction to be followed by
preparation for mismatched allo-BMT.

Since recent discharge on [**2174-4-13**], patient has been followed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in clinic with progressively increased from a
white count of 4800 with 80% blasts on discharge to 61,700
and 98% blasts on [**4-19**], the day prior to admission.  She has
been treated with increases of Hydrea 1 gram q.d. to 3 grams
q.d. on admission.

Currently, patient describes progressive increase in fatigue
without fevers, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, cough,
chest pain, or extremity pain.  She reports nausea with
medications relieved by Ativan without any new right lower
quadrant abdominal pain or discomfort.  Patient denies recent
bruising, bleeding, or headache/changes in mental status.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  Vancomycin has in the
past been reported to cause rash, that is false.  AmBisome
causes diaphoresis, severe nausea, vomiting, and chills.  Has
been avoided as needed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Progressive AML diagnosed [**3-9**].  See
history of present illness for details.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Hydrea 3000 mg b.i.d.
2. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Ativan 0.5 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. prn anxiety and
nausea.  Hickman line care.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with family in [**Location (un) 1468**], I
believe.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No known history of leukemia.

VITAL SIGNS:  T current 97.7, 110, 114/66, 20, and 99% on
room air.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  In no apparent distress, alert and oriented
times three.  Patient was anicteric.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Moist oral mucosa.  No oral petechiae or
hemorrhages.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Tachycardic, regular
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended without rebound or
guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly was noted.  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema, 2+ pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count of 69.2
with 93% blasts, hematocrit 27.0, platelets 339.  Chem-7 was
unremarkable.  LFTs were unremarkable.  Uric acid was 2.9.

RELEVANT STUDIES:  He had a [**4-12**] abdominal CT, which showed
persistent inflammatory phlegmon surrounding appendix to
cecal tip.  The small fluid collection was undrainable.

She had an echocardiogram [**3-2**], which showed an EF of 65%.
Normal study.

Micro data:  Blood cultures drawn [**4-18**] are pending.

In summary, this is a 26-year-old female with resistant and
progressive AML readmitted for 7 + 3 reinduction to be
followed by Cytoxan/TBI and mismatched MUD allo-BMT.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. AML:  Patient was reinduced with idarubicin and cytarabine
7 + 3 with appropriate reduction in her white blood cell
count.  She remained neutropenic at the time of this
dictation [**2174-5-6**] with pancytopenia.  She was treated with
supportive care with blood and platelets, and remained on
neutropenic precautions given the appropriate mouth care,
repletion of electrolytes, bowel regimen, pain control, etc.

At this point in time, the decision to proceed with allo-BMT
was pending.  The recommendations of the attending physicians
had not been decided at this time.  Please see additional
dictation summary for further treatment of the patient's AML.

2. Fever and neutropenia:  Patient was intermittently febrile
throughout her hospital course while she was on neutropenic.
She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for a known
right lower quadrant inflammatory process, and was treated
with Flagyl, voriconazole, meropenem, Vancomycin, acyclovir,
and most recently ciprofloxacin.  Patient continued to spike
fevers through antibiotic treatments.  She had been cultured
on multiple occasions with negative culture data to date.
She has been followed with serial abdominal exams and CAT
scans of her abdomen.

Most recently she had a CT of the torso on [**2174-5-5**], which
showed no disease within the chest with a small stable
pulmonary nodule.  However, her CT of her abdomen and pelvis
showed progression of her extensive inflammatory changes
involving the appendix.  No drainable fluid collections,
however, there was free fluid within the right pelvis.

Additionally, the patient has noticed some interval change in
her abdomen with sensation of fullness within her right lower
quadrant, though she continues to deny pain.  Consequently at
this time, given her limited options, she has been seen by
Surgery.  However, surgery in this instance has not been
recommended.  We will continue to treat her with
broad-spectrum antibiotics with the understanding that her
counts will not recover at this time without transplant.

3. FEN:  The patient remained NPO throughout her hospital
stay.  She was started on TPN and continued to have her
electrolytes repleted by scale.

ADDENDUM:  Please see next dictation by the following intern
for complete details on the rest of her hospital course.

.
[**3-14**] CXR:
 FINDINGS:  Compared with 04/16, allowing for differences in
position, the left pleural effusion is probably not
significantly changed.
.
The multifocal infiltrates in the right mid and lower lung
fields appear to have become more confluent superiorly.
Persistent retrocardiac collapse/consolidation.
 .
The visualized portions of the left lung are grossly clear.  No
CHF
.
[**2-25**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Complex-appearing right pleural effusion, with loculated
components.  The pleura does not clearly enhance, thus this
loculated effusion is not necessarily an empyema.
2.  There is dense consolidative change with cystic spaces
within the right lower lobe.  The finding is concerning for a
cavitating pneumonia.  However, this lung parenchyma is not
evaluated for an underlying mass lesion, and one cannot be
excluded.
3.  Severe emphysematous changes of the lungs.
4.  Scattered nodular opacities within the left lung.
Three-month CT followup is recommended.
5.  Small pericardial effusion.
6.  5 cm arterially enhancing mass of the liver at the
confluence of hepatic veins, not characterized. When the
patient's condition improves, if he is able to breath hold, a
contrast enhanced MRI is recommended. If he cannot breath hold,
multiphase CT is recommended.
.
[**3-4**] RUQ U/S:
 ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  The liver is normal in echotexture.
Multiple hepatic cysts are seen, the largest of which is in the
right lobe measuring 4.3 x 3.8 x 4.3 cm.  Additionally, there is
a hypoechoic solid lesion in the lateral aspect of the right
lobe measuring 5.2 x 5.6 x 4.7 cm.  This lesion has a central
feeding artery.  Multiple small stones are seen within the
gallbladder and the wall is thickened measuring 3 mm, however
this is likely related to
hypoalbuminemia as there is a small amount of ascites and large
left pleural effusion.  The gallbladder is not distended.
Common hepatic duct measures 1.3 cm and the pancreatic duct is
also mildly dilated measuring 0.3 cm.  No discrete pancreatic
head mass is identified.  The portal vein is patent with
anterograde flow.  Limited views of the kidneys demonstrate no
hydronephrosis. An additional solid hypoechoic vascular mass is
seen above the left kidney measuring 3.3 x 2.6 x 3.4 cm.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Solid hypoechoic masses are seen in the right lobe of the
liver and above the left kidney, concerning for metastases.
Recommend CT of the abdomen for metastatic work-up, or hepatic
MRI if there is clinical concern for a primary hepatocellular
carcinoma.
2.  Multiple hepatic cysts.
3.  Dilatation of the common hepatic duct and pancreatic duct
with no discrete mass seen in the pancreatic head.  Again, this
could be evaluated with abdominal CT.
4.  Cholelithiasis and gallbladder wall edema, likely related to

hypoalbuminemia.
5.  A small amount of ascites and large left pleural effusion.
.
[**3-1**] ECHO: EF 75-80%
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular  systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is  mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2-25**] Pleural fluid negative for malignancy
.
[**3-19**] CT Abd/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1.  Poorly defined predominantly hyperehancing mass within the
medial right
hepatic dome just to the right of the IVC surrounding and
narrowing the right
hepatic vein. CT imaging characteristics are not specific but
differential
includes hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma or even a
solitary
metastasis. Further charactherization of this mass is
recommended with MRI.
2.  Complex right lower lobe empyema/parapneumonic effusion.
There is an
adjacent right lower lobe consolidation.
3.  Decrease in the more simple-appearing left pleural effusion
and left lower
lobe atelectasis.
4.  Gallstones.
5.  Several left upper quadrant splenules.
6.  Multiple hepatic and renal cysts.
7.  Descending and sigmoid colonic diverticula.
8.  2-3 mm lingula nodule.  Interval follow up is recommended.
Length of
follow up (3-6 months vs 1 year) should be determined based on
whether the
patients has a primary malignancy
.
[**3-21**] Liver Biopsy:
Liver needle biopsy:

Adenocarcinoma.
Immunostains of the tumor are strongly positive for cytokeratin
CK7, weakly positive for CK20, and negative for TTF-1, with
satisfactory controls.
Iron stain:  Moderate iron deposition in hepatocytes.
Trichrome stain is reviewed.
Note:  The tumor histology and immunostains are most consistent
with a biliary/pancreatic origin, including both primary
cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic disease.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was
provided a preliminary diagnosis on [**2158-3-22**].
.
[**2158-3-24**] Colonoscopy
Findings:
 Protruding Lesions A single sessile 4 mm polyp of benign
appearance was found in the ascending colon. A piece-meal
polypectomy was performed using a hot snare. The polyp was
completely removed.
Impression: Polyp in the ascending colon (polypectomy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
[**2158-3-30**] EGD:
Findings: normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. No signs of
bleeding.
.
[**2158-4-6**] CT Torso:
1.  Persistent right empyema with adjacent opacities consistent
with
pneumonia, aspiration or atelectasis.
2.  Increased intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation,
as well as somewhat increased prominence of the pancreatic duct.
 This could suggest an obstructive process near the ampulla, and
although no stone or clot is directly observed there, the
presence of a stone or blood clot would often not be observable
on CT.
4.  Cholelithiasis.
5.  Satisfactory position of gastrojejunostomy tube.
6.  Stable L2 compression fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 74 yo male with a history of COPD admitted with Strep
milleri empyema, now s/p CT tube removal and full course abx,
with intercurrent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of likely biliary
primary, course complicated by recurrent aspiration pna and
blood loss anemia
.
# Blood loss anemia- Patient has chronic, macrocytic anemia
likely due to alcohol use; B12 and folate were within normal
limits. However, Hct acutely dropped from 25.5 on [**3-27**] to 19.1
on [**3-29**]; EGD, [**Last Name (un) **], CT torso all negative for source of bleeding
and Hct responded appropriately to 2units PRBCs and remained
stable at 26-27. Then, after PEG placement, patient had maroon,
guaiac positive stool x1, remained hemodynamically stable.
Lavage from PEG was clear/yellow, no blood seen. Patient has not
had further melena although loose brown bowel movement yesterday
was guaiac positive. CT abd/pelvis did not reveal any bleeding
around PEG site. Discussed with GI briefly possible additional
work-up for unexplained Hct drops; ERCP or push enteroscopy with
side view scope could identify hematobilia if present, although
this is unlikely as explanation of bleeding requiring
transfusion since hematobilia would be more chronic; they could
perform procedure diagnostically but there would not be
endoscopic therapeutic options. Therefore, monitor Hct and
transfusing supportively may be best option for this patient.
Continue [**Hospital1 **] ppi, iron.
.
# Recurrent/aspiration pna: after completing full course (5
weeks) antibiotics for Strep milleri pneumonia with empyema
drained with chest tubes, patient had increasing rhonchi,
leukocytosis, low grade fevers. Given his known aspiration risk
and prolonged hospital stay, treating empirically with
zosyn/vanc for total 3 weeks, which will be through [**4-24**].
Continue pulmonary toilet, supplemental O2
.
# persistent leukocytosis: WBC remains [**11-11**] thousand despite
long course of antibiotics directed at empyema; afebrile.
Continue antibiotics.
.
# COPD- Long time smoker, 4L O2 at home. Received pulse dose
steroids in ICU in early [**Month (only) 547**]. Atrovent/Alb inhalers. Continue
oxygen by nasal cannula.
.
# L2 vertebral body fracture: seen incidentally on CT torso,
patient complained only of same chronic/intermittent LBP.
Neurosurg/spine saw patient and reviewed films, recommended TLSO
brace only if patient having pain that limits ambulation.
.
# ETOH use- Pt drinks 3-4 beers daily in morning and glass of
wine at night. No signs/sx of withdrawal this admission and out
of time window. Continue MVI, thiamine, folate, B12
.
# Adenocarcinoma: Per pathology prelim read, biopsy specimen c/w
adenocarcinoma (not hepatocellular), unlikely lung or colon
based on immunohistochemical staining so most likely
cholangiocarcinoma. CEA <1; AFP 8.8 (0-8.7, ref range); CA19-9
26 (0-37, ref range). Hep serologies neg. No h/o prostate CA and
PSA wnl. + strong smoking history so possibility of Lung ca w/
met but no obvious lesion on CT chest. ? could be a lesion
hiding in his RLL PNA/empyema. Colonoscopy w/ one small polyp
but no other concerning lesions. EGD normal. Remainder of
staging will be completed as outpatient (arranged with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
by heme-onc consult team).
.
# Thrombocytosis- Multifactorial, from alcohol, iron deficiency,
and inflammation.
.
# s/p percutaneous gastrostomy-jejunal feeding tube: Patient
required feeding tube for aspiration risk; speech and swallow
therapists optimistic that patient will be able to regain
swallow function with exercise. Pain meds for tenderness at
insertion site. Per IR, sutures used to tack stomach to abd wall
should be removed on [**4-12**]; sutures can be cut externally and
internal/gastric portion will resorb/pass.

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 85-year-old male
with multiple medical problems, who presents with a one day
history of pleuritic back pain and shortness of breath.  It
began the night prior to admission when he took a deep breath
and noticed a pain between his scapulae.  It became
progressively worse, to the point where he was unable to take
deep breaths.  He had no recent cough, fever, chills, chest
pain, headaches, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, weakness
or dysuria.  His ambulation was limited by claudication, not
dyspnea on exertion.  He denies baseline shortness of breath,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
or lower extremity edema.  He had a recent right upper lobe
pneumonia in [**Month (only) 205**], status post a seven day course of
levofloxacin with an additional admission in [**Month (only) 216**], as his
pneumonia did not clear.  At that point, he had a
parapneumonic effusion that was tapped and showed to be
exudative.  He received a second course of antibiotics,
namely Levaquin and Flagyl, at that time and underwent
bronchoscopy to look for an obstructive lesion.  The
bronchoscopy revealed an apical right upper lobe
endobronchial lesion, but the biopsy and bronchoalveolar
lavage were negative for malignant cells.  He was followed up
by his pulmonologist as an outpatient in [**Month (only) 359**], and was
doing well.  He was asymptomatic at that time.  The plan was
to repeat a CT scan in [**Month (only) 1096**] to look for resolution of his
air space disease.

He presented to the Emergency Room, where he was febrile, and
a chest x-ray showed opacification of his right lung,
questionable infiltrate vs. effusion.  He was started on
levofloxacin and Flagyl and admitted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right upper lobe pneumonia described above, status post
one seven day course of levofloxacin and one 14 day course of
levofloxacin and Flagyl
2.  History of congestive heart failure with diastolic
dysfunction.  An echocardiogram in [**2152-12-30**] showed an
ejection fraction of 55%.
3.  Hypertension complicated by chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 to 2.4, complicated by
anemia on Epogen
4.  Iron-deficiency anemia status post an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2154-7-31**] that showed a
gastric arteriovenous malformation status post BiPAP cautery.
A colonoscopy in [**2154-7-31**] was negative.  Colonoscopy in
[**2153-6-30**] revealed an adenomatous polyp that was removed.
The colonoscopy in [**2153-6-30**] was done in the setting of a
gastrointestinal bleed.
5.  Gastrointestinal bleed x 2, once in [**2153-6-30**], once in
[**2154-7-31**], the first time from an adenomatous colonic
polyp, the second time from a gastric arteriovenous
malformation.
6.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.8 cm currently, not
been repaired
7.  Left eye blindness secondary to macular degeneration
8.  Carotid disease with a 90% right internal carotid artery
stenosis, status post a left carotid endarterectomy
9.  Osteoarthritis
10. Peripheral neuropathy, likely secondary to alcohol use
11. History of peptic ulcer disease
12. Nephrolithiasis
13. Cholelithiasis

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day
2.  Lasix 20 mg once daily
3.  Norvasc 10 mg once daily
4.  Aspirin 325 mg once daily
5.  Niferex 50 mg twice a day
6.  Epogen 3000 units every Wednesday

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He lives with his wife and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
smoked three cigars a day for many years, but quit three
months ago.  He drinks two beers and two glasses of brandy
every night.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

He has received his flu shot this year.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Positive for claudication for the past
five to six years, that is unchanged.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   This is an elderly man, in no acute
distress, who is febrile with a temperature of 101.4,
tachycardic with a heart rate of 106.  His blood pressure is
164/71, and his respiratory rate is 28.  His oxygen
saturation is 92% on room air, and improves to 94% on 2
liters nasal cannula.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination is unremarkable.  He has no jugular venous
distention or lymphadenopathy.  His lungs have decreased
breath sounds at the right base with dullness and no
egophony.  His left lung is clear to auscultation.  His heart
is regular, with no murmurs.  The abdomen is distended, which
he says is a chronic finding.  It is nontender, with good
bowel sounds.  He has no palpable hepatosplenomegaly,
although he is quite distended.  He is guaiac negative.  His
extremities are without edema and with 1+ distal pulses.  He
has no calf tenderness.  He has no lower extremity asymmetry.
His neurological examination is nonfocal, with intact cranial
nerves, normal sensation, and 5/5 strength in all four
extremities.

Chest x-ray reveals an unchanged right upper lobe opacity
from his last chest x-ray, and a new right base opacity,
question effusion vs. infiltrate.  His left lung is clear.
There is no widening of the mediastinum.

Electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia at 108.  He has a
right bundle branch block and a left anterior fascicular
block.  He has a right ventricular strain pattern with S1 Q3
T3 that is old.  His electrocardiogram is unchanged from his
baseline electrocardiogram.

LABORATORY DATA:   He presented with a white count of 22.9,
hematocrit of 30.2, and a platelet count of 514.  He also had
a left shift with a differential that was 93% polys, 3%
lymphs and 3% monos.  His coagulations were within normal
limits.  His electrolytes were likewise within normal limits
except for a BUN of 34, creatinine of 2.4, and glucose of
160.  His liver function tests were normal.  His amylase and
lipase were normal as well.  His albumin was 4.  He ruled out
for a myocardial infarction with negative CKs and troponins.
His blood cultures were negative.  A cholesterol panel was
checked, which revealed a cholesterol of 120, with an HDL of
42 and an LDL of 56.  His triglycerides were 109.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Mr. [**Known lastname 3075**] was admitted with a recurrent
right pneumonia and increased opacity of his right lung with
question of effusion.  An ultrasound-guided tap was
performed, which drained 1.5 liters of fluid.  He was changed
to ceftriaxone and Flagyl, given his two previous courses of
levofloxacin.  A chest CT was also obtained to evaluate his
effusion, which was shown to be a loculated complicated one.
His pleural fluid revealed an empyema that was growing alpha
streptococcus.

On [**11-23**], he underwent thoracotomy with decortication for
treatment of his empyema.  Cytology, cell block,
intraoperative bronchoscopy and biopsies all were negative
for malignancy.  Given that he was growing streptococcus, he
was changed to penicillin-G for a two week course.  A PICC
line was placed for access.

He was also ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  During
his stay, he was continued on his Lopressor, Norvasc and
aspirin.  His aspirin was held preoperatively and then
restarted afterwards.

His creatinine increased from his baseline to 3.0 due to
pre-renal azotemia.  He responded well to intravenous fluids,
and his creatinine decreased to his baseline by the time of
discharge.

He has iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastrointestinal
bleed.  His hematocrit remained stable during his
hospitalization, but after his surgery, he was quite
fatigued, and so he was transfused two units.

Postoperatively, his chest tubes were removed after they had
minimal drainage with no evidence of air leak.

He suffered from delirium postoperatively, which was likely
multifactorial, related to pain medication, anesthesia,
infection, and distress from surgery.  It resolved slowly,
with an improvement in his mental status to baseline. Low
dose Haldol effectively treated his acute symptoms.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation for
strengthening postoperatively.  He will need to follow up
with his pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2146**], in two to four weeks.
He may need to follow up with Interventional Pulmonary for a
repeat bronchoscopy in four to six weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Alpha streptococcal pneumonia with loculated empyema
status post decortication
2.  Hypertension complicated by chronic renal insufficiency
3.  Diastolic dysfunction
4.  Iron-deficiency anemia from gastrointestinal bleed
5.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm
6.  Left eye blindness secondary to macular degeneration

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg twice a day
2.  Lasix 20 mg once daily
3.  Norvasc 10 mg once daily
4.  Aspirin 325 mg once daily

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old man
with no cardiac symptoms who was evaluated for a lip
resection and had a positive stress test preoperatively.
Catheterization after the post stress test showed severe left
main and three-vessel disease.  He also had the recent onset
of atrial fibrillation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant only for lip carcinoma.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to admission white count was 8.0,
hematocrit 49.1, platelet count 387; potassium 4.0, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.9, blood sugar 108.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was a pleasant,
comfortable, chronically ill-appearing gentleman in no acute
distress.  Vital signs:  Heart rate 64, blood pressure
187/68, respirations 22, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Lungs:  Breath sounds diminished in the right lower lobe.
Heart:  Irregularly irregular.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Carotids:  Bilateral soft bruit.
Extremities:  Warm and without edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following admission, the patient was
brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where he underwent
catheterization which showed severe left main and
three-vessel disease.  He tolerated the procedure well.
Please see the catheterization report for full details.

Following catheterization, the patient was discharged home.
He returned to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**7-19**]
where he was admitted directly to the Operating Room.  In the
Operating Room, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times two.  Please see operative report for full details.  In
summary the patient had an off-pump coronary artery bypass
graft times two with a LIMA to the left anterior descending,
and a saphenous vein graft to the LIMA and then to the right
coronary artery.  His aorta was severely calcific.  He was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, he had
epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine, and Propofol infusion.  He did
well in the immediate postoperative period.  He was weaned
off his cardioactive drugs.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He
was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.

He remained in the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day
#1.  At that time, he was started on Plavix.  Hemodynamically
he was stable.  He remained in the Intensive Care Unit
throughout postoperative day #1.  On postoperative day #2, he
was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where he
underwent PTCA.  Please see catheterization report for full
details.  In summary, the patient had an angioplasty to his
ramus and to the left circumflex with stent placement times
one to the ramus and stent times two to the left circumflex.
Following angioplasty, the patient was returned to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

Also on postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to have
atrial fibrillation.  He was started on Amiodarone drip
following which he converted to normal sinus rhythm.  The
patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for several
additional days due to difficulty clearing pulmonary
secretions.  A sputum culture at that time showed
gram-negative rods consistent with Hemophilus.  Chest x-ray
showed no congestive heart failure and a questionable left
lower lobe pneumonia.  At that time, he was begun on
Levofloxacin, as well as Albuterol, Atrovent, and Mucomyst
nebulizers.

On postoperative day #6, the patient was finally considered
to be stable and ready to be transferred to
................... for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  At that time, he remained
hemodynamically stable.  In addition to being followed by the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service, he was also seen by
Cardiology and the [**Hospital **] Clinic for assistance with diabetes
management.

Once on the floor with the assistance of Physical Therapy and
the nursing staff, the patient's activity level was increased
on a daily basis.  The patient continued to require
aggressive pulmonary toilet in order to clear his secretions,
and he continued to have a high oxygen requirement.

On postoperative day #10, the patient's Levofloxacin was
discontinued.  He remained hemodynamically stable.  His
pulmonary status continued to slowly improve, and by
postoperative day #13, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer, the patient's condition is stable.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. No LV mass/thrombus.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Severe AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild
(1+) MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - body habitus.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is an echodensity within the
posterior [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] that likely represents the ridge betweeen the left atrial
appendage and
the [**Doctor Last Name **] pulmonary vein (warfarin ridge). Left ventricular wall
thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Normal
LVEF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 106519**] was admitted after presentation to OSH ED for
syncopal episodes associated with a loss of consciousness and
CHF.  She was admitted for diuresis and cardiac monitoring.
Cardiology was consulted for management of CHF in the setting of
Aortic stenosis.  She was empirically placed on levaquin for
possible pneumonia.  Blood Cultures were negative after 72hours.
 She was gently diuresed toward her baseline weight.  Urine
culture showed a E. Coli UTI, sensitivities pending.  On
hospital day 4 Mrs. [**Known lastname 106519**] was 1.5kg below her baseline
weight, able to walk up two flights of stairs without distress,
denying any chest discomfort or shortness of breath at rest.
She has dental follow up scheduled with her dentist as an
outpatient for filling of two dental carries prior to AVR on
[**2161-4-10**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**].  She was  instructed to minimize her
trips out of her apartment (3 story walk up) and to call 911 and

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 60-year-old female is
status post MI in 11/00 and had an RCA stent.  She was doing
well until [**1-20**] when she began experiencing increased
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion and saw her
cardiologist.  She had a positive stress test and then a
cardiac catheterization and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for
cardiac surgery.  Her cardiac catheterization was done on
[**2164-5-30**] and revealed the left main had a 50% ostial lesion.
The left circumflex had a 60-70% lesion.  The RCA revealed a
fractured stent and an 80% ostial lesion.  She had 1+ MR,
global hypokinesis with an EF of 46%.  She is now admitted
for CABG.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of Hodgkin's disease with mantle radiation.
2.  History of basal cell carcinoma of the back.
3.  Status post right breast CA.  Status post right
mastectomy and lymphatic resection.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Femara 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lescol XL 80 mg p.o. q.d.

6.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to IVP dye, gets hives and gets
bruises with Plavix.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She does not
drink alcohol.  She lives with her husband.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  She is a
well-developed, well-nourished white female in no apparent
distress.  Vital signs:  Stable.  Afebrile.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was benign.  Neck:  Supple, full
range of motion, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  The
carotids were 2+ and equal bilaterally without bruits.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, with
positive bowel sounds.  No masses.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses:
The pulses were 1+ and equal bilaterally throughout.  She had
a well-healed right mastectomy incision.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2164-7-25**], she underwent CABG times three
with reversed saphenous vein graft to the LAD, OM, and PDA.
The cross clamp time was 63 minutes, total bypass time 90
minutes.  She was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine and propofol.  She
required substantial amounts of volume on her postoperative
night for her cardiac index but was weaned and extubated the
following morning.

On postoperative day number two, she had her chest tubes
discontinued.  She was on Neo but this was eventually weaned
off.  She was transferred to the floor in stable condition.
She continued to have a stable postoperative course.  She had
her epicardial pacing wires discontinued.  On postoperative
day number three, she was fairly slow to ambulate.  She also
complained of left fingertip numbness in the median
distribution and pain in her left arm, all of which she had
preoperatively.

She was seen by Neurology.  They wanted an EMG done as an
outpatient and to be followed and she also had Orthopedics
see her and she had wrist films which revealed osteopenia but
no fractures.  The occupational therapist gave her a splint
for her wrist.  She also had an Ophthalmology consult because
she had some visual changes which they felt were due to
medication but they felt that she could be followed-up by her
primary care ophthalmologist.  On postoperative day number
eight, she was discharged to home in stable condition.

Her laboratories on discharge revealed a white count of
8,600, hematocrit 30.9, blood sugar 235, sodium 137,
potassium 4.1, chloride 99, C02 27, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1,
blood sugar 97.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days.
2.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o. q.d. times seven days.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  .................... 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lescol 80 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Levoxyl 112 micrograms p.o.q .d.
8.  Tylenol #3 one to two p.o. q. four to six hours p.r.n.
pain.
9.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q. eight hours p.r.n. pain.
10. Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  She will have an EMG of her left arm in two weeks
and then be seen by Neurology in three to four weeks and then
following that if needed she will need Orthopedics.  She will
see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two to
three weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.

upgoing.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2109-7-1**].  At that time she was found to have a large
multi-cystic lesion in the right frontal lobe.  In addition
there was a very vascular nodule in the medial wall.  This
was resected without difficulty.  An Ommaya reservoir was
left in the cavity of the cyst.  Postoperatively the patient
did well.  She woke up neurologically intact.  She had a bit
of a headache.  She was kept in the Intensive Care Unit
overnight. She was then transferred to the floor.

She was continued on her steroids.  She had just a tiny
amount of subgaleal fluid, which was soft.  Her incision
remained clean and dry.  She began eating.  She was up and
ambulating.  She was seen by Physical Therapy who felt that
she was steady on her feet and could ambulate independently.
Her pathology was suggestive of a dysembryoplastic
angio-neuroepithelial lesion.  This showed areas which
appeared to be cavernous angioma with thin walled vessels and
proliferations of small numbers of oligodendrocytes.  The
MIB-1 proliferation index was less than 1%.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was informed of her pathology report
and the likelihood for a follow-up MRI scan.  She will be
seen in consultation by the Neurologic oncologist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Right frontal mass.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will keep her wound
clean and dry.  She has been written for a Decadron taper.
She will be seen in follow-up in one weeks time.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8878**] is a 48-year-old gentleman with
biopsy-proven T4 carcinoma of the right upper lobe presenting
a superior vena caval syndrome. He received induction
chemoradiotherapy with an excellent response and no evidence
for distant disease. He had adequate functional reserve, and
given his youth and good performance status, an
aggressive approach to resect the disease and reconstruct his
central veins was planned for this admission.

Past Medical History:
-Stage IIIB (T4) NSCLCA
-s/p RUL lobectomy en bloc w/ SVC and brachiocephalic veins
resection and [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-tex reconstruction of SVC and brachiocephalic

-s/p radiation and chemotherapy

Social History:
History of 1ppd tobacco use. Patient lives with his partner in
[**Location (un) 538**]. He works for a company that sells scientific
research equipment.


Family History:
Notable for extensive CAD in multiple relatives in their 50's,
including his father, who had an MI at age 52.

Physical Exam:
General: well appearing anxious man in NAD
HEENT: notable for facial swelling consistant w/ SVC syndrome.
Chest: CTA bilat
COR: RRR S1,S2. Slightly distant heart sounds.
Abd: soft, round, NT, ND, +BS
Extrem: no LE C/C/E
neuro: intact

Pertinent Results:
[**2144-5-10**] CXR
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2144-5-10**] at
approximately 13:15 hours following the removal of a right sided
pleural tube. The right sided hydropneumothorax is not
significantly changed since the prior examination. Minimal left
costophrenic angle blunting may represent fibrosis or a small
left pleural effusion. Evidence of surgery in the right upper
lobe.

IMPRESSION:
Stable appearances of the chest following chest tube removal.

[**2144-5-8**] Chest CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No large fluid collection to explain hematocrit drop
identified. Expected area of dense atelectasis and probable
hematoma noted within the surgical bed.
2. Pneumomediastinum and right-sided hydropneumothorax with
small air component. Chest tube/drains appear appropriately
positioned.
3. Surgical chain sutures and vascular grafts/stents from recent
right upper segmental resection and SVC reconstruction.
4. Consolidation noted within the medial right lower lobe may
represent atelectasis or early aspiration pneumonitis. This may
be followed up on subsequent imaging.
5. Stable left back sebaceous cyst.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64 year old woman with a history of diabetes and
mental retardation who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED on [**7-16**]
with acute renal failure and back pain.
.
Patient is mentally retarded and has a 24 hour caregiver. She
was recently seen in the ED and plain films were done of the hip
and lumbar spine which showed no fracure and mild spinal
stenosis. She was discharged on vicodin. She returned several
days later and had an injection to her back or hip. According to
her caregiver she has been taking less pos and has not taken her
medications recently. Two days prior to admission she had a
temperature of 102 at home. She is usually very functional and
holds a job, but over the last two days she has been combative
and uncooperative and refused to go to work. She was seen in her
PCP's office where she was noted to have no temperature and her
symptoms were felt to be due to back pain from spinal stenosis.
.
In the ED at [**Location (un) 620**] her creatinine on admission was 7.2 up from
a baseline of 0.9. BUN was 127, AG 28, lactate 4.0 (delta/delta
was 1). Her initial vitals were T 99.1, BP 90-112/45-57 with HR
90s, RR 27-45, O2 sat 91-96% on 2L. ABG was 7.28/18/65. She had
only 89 cc of urine output.
.
 Urine had > 100 wbc, moderate bacteria (MSSA), positive
nitrite, and moderate wbc. Per renal there were muddy brown
casts.
.
She was started on D5W with 150 mEq of NaHCO3 at 200cc/hr and
received 1650 cc. She also received flagyl, vancomycin,
levofloxacin and ceftazadime. Her ABG improved to 7.46/29/81;
however her respiratory status declined and she was intubated
for hypoxia and acidosis in the setting of sepsi and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 year old woman with mental retardation and history of
diabetes presents with acute renal failure [**2-23**] to sepsis and
subsequent ATN requiring dialysis.
.
#) ID: Infectious foci this admission include lower paraspinal
abscesses, sphenoid sinus collections, upper spinal phlegmons,
UTI, and possible line infection. She was septic at admission
and required ICU care and mechanical ventilation for respiratory
failure (now resolved).
A) Paraspinal abscesses: Initial MRI revealed epidural abcess
from L4 to brain. Possible phlegmon not epidural abcess in
brain.  On [**2136-7-23**] cultures from the abscess grew MSSA.
Paraspinal abscesses were drained by Orthopedics/Spine on
[**2135-7-27**].  However, on [**2136-8-14**] Ortho was reconsulted for wound
drainage and low grade temps. A repeat MRI at that time was
consistent with discitis, osteomyelitis and primarily ventral
epidural abscess at T6, T7 and T8 have improved and there is
less spinal cord compression compared to [**7-29**]. There appears to
have been a second poorly visualized epidural abscess ventrally
at the T4 level. It has also improved. There is a loculated
collection laterally at the T6 level, little changed.  The ortho
spine attending did not feel that this required further drainage
due to patient's improving clinical status.  Patient was treated
with a course of Nafcillin.  B) B/L sphenoid sinuses were
drained by ENT on [**2136-7-28**]. C)Upper spinal phlegmons were not
amenable to drainage, therefore will be treated with IV
antibiotics. D) MSSA UTI was treated with 10day course of
Ciprofloxacin (per ID recs) though it was likely [**2-23**]/
hematoligic spread of her sepsis.  E) The patient developed high
fevers (>105 F) on [**8-22**] and [**8-23**]. Abdominal CT at that time was
negative. The fevers were thought to be [**2-23**] line infections. Her
HD tunneled catheter was pulled [**8-24**] and her antibiotics were
broadened. Blood cultures failed to grow any pathogen. The
fevers resolved after removal of the line. After two days of
being afebrile and with negative blood cultures, a temporary HD
catheter was placed [**8-27**].  A permanent tunneled HD catheter was
placed [**8-30**].  F) The patient developed diarrhea on [**8-21**], and
metronidazole was started empirically.  (C diff negative.)  The
patient will be discharged on oral metronidazole to be continued
as long as she is on Nafcillin.
A TEE on [**7-25**] was negative for endocarditis. MRV negative for
jugular thrombus
PLAN- Patient will complete a six week course of IV Nafcillin (2
grams q4hours).  She will be evaluated by ID upon completion of
this course at which time recommendations for any further
antibiotic treatment will be made.  The patient also has a 6
week follow up appointment with Ortho/Spine re: her paraspinal
abscess.
.
#) Renal failure: Pt developed ARF [**2-23**] to sepsis and consequent
ATN. The renal team was consulted and followed the patient
closely throughout her admission. She developed rising
creatinine and oliguria refractory to high-dose diuretics.
Therefore she was started on hemodialysis on [**7-20**].  A
tunneled IJ catheter was placed.  As her HD catheter was thought
to be cause of fever/sepsis [**8-22**] and [**8-23**], line pulled [**8-24**].  A
temporary IR placed HD catheter was placed [**8-27**], this was changed
for a permanent catheter on [**8-30**].  She is currently on HD MWF.
She continues on Nephrocaps.  She was initially oliguric,
however on [**8-27**] she began to make increasing amounts of urine.
Per Renal, she continued to require TIW dialysis at discharge,
however, the patient will follow up with renal as an outpatient
for monitoring of her renal function as we do hope that it will
continue to improve and she may not require lifetime dialysis.
  .
#) SDH: CT scan done [**7-19**] showed small subdural hemorrhage.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and they recommended a goal INR of
<1.3, but stated that prophylactic SQ heparin would not be
problem[**Name (NI) 115**].  She was treated with keppra (500 [**Hospital1 **] X 2 days,
1000mg [**Hospital1 **] X 8 days). A repeat head CT revealed improvement in
SDH.

#) Afib w/ RVR: Patient had an episode of afib with RVR on [**7-19**].
The Afib resolved with 5 mg IV lopressor.  She did have 2
recurrent episodes of afib during the admission (most recently
[**8-6**]), both of which quickly resolved with Metoprolol 5 mg IV
x1. She remained in normal sinus rhythm for the rest of the
admission and is discharged on low dose Metoprolol.

#) Elevated LFTS: most likely from sepsis, though patient was
complaining of abdominal pain. No obvious abnormality on CT
scan. US of liver  showed Diffusely increased echogenicity
throughout the liver. Finding likely reflecting fatty
infiltration, although more severe forms of liver disease
including hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis are not excluded. By
[**8-3**] her LFT's has trended down, however her alkaline phos
remained elevated throughout the admission, etiology was
unclear, however an elevated GGT suggested a hepatic etiology.
.
#)GI: Patient developed increasing abdominal pain on [**8-20**].  KUB
at that time revealed possible ileus, Abdominal CT on [**8-21**] and
again on [**8-24**] were unremarkable.  The patient then developed
diarrhea.  C Diff was negative x1, however, the patient was
started on empiric PO metronidazole.  She will continue on
metronidazole for the course of her naficillin regimen.
.
#) Diabetes: The patient has a history of non-insulin dependent
DM.  She was managed on an regular insulin sliding scale
throughout the admission.  There were no active issues with her
diabetes.
.
#) Anemia: The patient received multiple transfusions of PRBCs
this admission for low Hct.  Her anemia is thought to be [**2-23**]
chronic disease.

#) Psych- the patient has a history of anxiety.  She was
continued on her home medication regimen.  She did require daily
emotional support from the nursing staff.
.
* On day of discharge her foley was discontinued and she was
noted to have cloudy urine.  UA was consistent with UTI.  She
was discharged on a short-course of renally-dosed levofloxacin.

The patient was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**Month (only) **]
[**2160**]. Two to three months prior to the presentation, she
devolped slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion and cough,
thought to be due to metastatic mass compressing her left
bronchial tree. She presented to interventional pulmonary for
elective rigid bronchoscopy/tumor debulking/stent placement on
[**12-6**]. During debulking procedure she developed endobronchial
bleeding, followed by hypotension and ST elevations in multiple
leads. Bedside TTE showed global hypokinesis with EF 20-25% and
the patient was taken to emergent cardiac cath wich showed
normal systemic pressures and normal coronaries. She was
transfused with 2units of packed red cells  for hematocrit of
23.3. Repeat echocardiogram showed improved left ventricular
function. The patient was extubated on [**12-7**] and transferred to
the general medical floor on [**2163-12-9**]

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Lung mass: patients pulmonary status remained stable during
the remainder of her hospital stay. She was taken to repeat
bronchoscopy on[**2163-12-12**], wich showed 60% occlusion at the LUL
[**Female First Name (un) 5309**]. No intervention was done during the procedure. Pulmonary
recommended argon photocoagulation therapy as an outpatient.
2. Blood loss: she had no signs of hemoptysis, her hematocrit
remained stable.
3. CV: initial global hypokinesis with mild troponin elevation
were believed to be due to coronary artery spasm. Repeat
echocardiogram showed improved left ventricular function. She
remained tachycardic (low 100s) for rest of her hospital stay,
without any additional ECG changes.
4. Renal cell carcinoma: the plans were to continue Avastin as
outpatient. The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
5. Yeast infection: the patient developed vaginal yeast
infection, affecting perineal region as well, she was treated
with Miconazole powder with only partial response. SHe was given
one dose of Diflucan, Monistat and Doxepin on the day od
discharge.

bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2195-2-5**] to the
cardiothoracic service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] with the initial
diagnosis of coronary artery disease, unstable angina,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased
cholesterol, AS, sleep apnea and obesity.  The patient had
coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 which included a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal right coronary
artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal
diagonal sequential.  The patient also had an aortic valve
replacement, a 21 mm mosaic porcine valve.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's
postoperative stay was complicated and total in-hospital days
was over 100.

The patient's initial hospital course was uncomplicated
within the intensive care unit.  On [**2-7**] the patient had a
bronchoscopy in which mucous plugs were removed from the
right upper lobe.  In early [**Month (only) 404**] the patient had
difficulty swallowing with possible aspiration.  Speech and
swallow evaluated the patient and noted that the patient had
severe upper esophageal achalasia.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] saw the
patient and agreed the patient would need a dilatation of the
esophagus and placement of a feeding tube.

On [**2195-2-14**] the patient was brought to the operating room and
had a dilatation of the esophagus with [**Doctor Last Name 953**] dilators and
placement of a percutaneous feeding tube.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On [**2195-2-19**] renal saw the patient for increased BUN and
creatinine.  They initially thought the patient was prerenal
or could possibly have ATN.  Their initial recommendations
were to repeat the urinalysis, cultures, electrolytes,
discontinue Lasix and discontinue non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs.  The patient was still intubated at
that time and it was also decided that the patient would
benefit from a tracheostomy.

On [**2195-2-20**] a tracheostomy tube was placed for respiratory
failure, inability to wean from a vent.  A percutaneous
tracheostomy tube placement of a #8 Shiley tube was done by
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 954**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 955**].  The surgery was uncomplicated
and the patient was transferred back to the CSRU in stable
condition.

On [**2195-2-21**] plastic surgery was asked to see the patient for
nonhealing saphenous vein graft donor sites where t.i.d.
dressing changes were then instituted and recommendations for
a V.A.C. to follow.

A her renal function did not return, the renal service
continued to follow closely and thought this could be a
mixture of acute tubular necrosis and prerenal disorder.  On
[**2195-2-16**] a right femoral vein dialysis catheter was placed
using the Seldinger technique for increased creatinine and
acute renal failure.

At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] the percutaneous tube subsequently
resulted in necrosis of the abdominal wall at the site of the
G-tube.  This was treated with nasogastric tube decompression
and tube feedings distal to the pylorus to allow the wound to
heal.  The gastrocutaneous fistula closed but the patient
developed extensive left leg cellulitis and induration.  The
patient was brought to the operating room on [**2195-3-17**] and had
a left abdominal wall and flank incision and drainage of the
deep soft tissue.  At that time the patient's chest also
showed signs of infection and drainage.  Initially wet-to-dry
dressings were started at the area and a V.A.C. dressing was
then placed to aid in healing.

Urology was also consulted at this time for hematuria which
responded to irrigation.  The hematuria resolved
spontaneously.  The renal failure continued throughout the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay with hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.

Infectious disease was consulted for Klebsiella in the sputum
and Gram-negative rods for which the patient was placed on
cefuroxime.  They also evaluated for the chest wall abdominal
wounds.

At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] also the patient had a cystoscopy to
evaluate for the hematuria.  At that time the urology team
recommended repeat alum irrigant x 2 days.

Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay the
gastrocutaneous fistula closed and the nasogastric tube was
subsequently clamped and then removed.  During the
hospitalization the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed
several times to equate with the bacteria in the wound,
sputum and urine.

EP was also consulted for arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation
for which the recommended medical treatment and
heparinization.

In [**Month (only) 956**] the patient continued to have issues with
infectious disease.  The patient had a sternal wound
dehiscence with a wound infection and gastrocutaneous
fistula, the lower right extremity wound infection and
Klebsiella pneumoniae which was causing septic symptoms.
During this time the patient was continued on Nepro tube
feeds for nutrition and antibiotics were used in relation to
bacteria growing in the cultures.  At that time the patient
was still MRSA negative.  There was sparse growth of
Klebsiella in the sputum and there was sparse growth of
Klebsiella in the fistula and sparse growth of B. fragilis
and beta lactamase positive in the right leg wound.

Over the hospital course the patient received multiple units
of packed red blood cells to normalize her hematocrit.

Urology concluded that the patient suffered from hemorrhagic
cystitis and on the 15th cleared the patient as doing well.
They decided that the patient was well enough urologically
that she would need no other treatment and that she could
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] after discharge.

During the hospital stay the patient had multiple central
lines placed for access.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] was consulted in mid
[**Month (only) 956**] for evaluation of nutrition and assistance with tube
feedings.

At the end of [**Month (only) 956**] the patient suffered from multiple
wound infections, failure to thrive and vent dependency.  The
patient also continued on hemodialysis for the acute renal
failure.  During [**Month (only) 958**] the patient continued to improve in a
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] fashion.  The patient's antibiotics were
slowly weaned off.  The patient continued on Nepro at 40 cc
an hour.

In the middle of [**Month (only) 958**] the patient was evaluated by GI for
intermittent bleeding.  The patient most likely had gastritis
or esophagitis per GI and they recommended endoscopic
evaluation.

This is an addendum to the discharge summary for the days
[**2-5**] to [**5-28**].

During the month of [**Month (only) 958**] the patient progressed with
physical therapy and treatments of her infections with
antibiotics and good nutrition.  At the end of [**Month (only) 958**] the
patient had a IJ Perm-A-Cath placed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
back to the CSRU in stable condition.  During this time the
patient was fed using a post pyloric tube while keeping the
nasogastric tube to suction to allow closure of
enterocutaneous fistula.  Toward the end of [**Month (only) 958**] the
nasogastric tube was removed.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] on the [**4-18**] placed a feeding jejunostomy tube.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported back to the
CSRU in stable condition.  Following surgery the patient was
restarted on the tube feeds Nepro 40 cc with 110 grams of
ProMod q.d.  The patient continued to progress during her
hospital stay and it was decided that the patient would be
able to be discharged to rehabilitation services for further
physical therapy.

On the [**4-26**] it was decided that the patient will be
able to be transferred to rehabilitation services.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, patient was found to have severe left
main disease and remained in the hospital for surgical
revascularization. Prior to surgery patient underwent an Echo
and Carotid U/S (please see pertinent results). He was cleared
for surgery and following consent pt was brought to the
operating room on hospital day two. He underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3 and tolerated the procedure well. Please
see op note for surgical details. He was transferred to the CSRU
in stable condition receiving Nitroglycerin and Propofol. Later
on op day sedation was weaned and patient awoke neurologically
intact. Mechanical ventilation was weaned and he was extubated.
By post op day one he was weaned off of all drips and started on
diuretics and B blockers. And was then transferred to the
step-down unit. On post op day two his chest tubes and Foley
catheter were removed. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for diabetes
management secondary to previously poor control (Hgb A1C 7.8)
and elevated glucose while in hospital. Appropriate changes were
made based on their recommendations. On post op day three
patient was very hyperglycemic and required transfer back to the
ICU for an Insulin drip. Post op day four glucose was 116 and he
was then transferred back to the step-down unit. Diabetes
management continued to remain difficult despite [**Last Name (un) **]
recommendations and will follow-up with them in 1 week following
discharge. His epicardial pacing wires were removed on post op
day six. He was followed throughout hospital course by physical
therapy for strength and conditioning. He cleared level 5 by
post op day seven and was discharged home with VNA services and
the appropriate follow-up appointments.

Service:  MED


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
female with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2188**], status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy including
prophylactic whole brain irradiation and stem cell rescue,
also with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on home oxygen and recurrent right sided pleural effusion who
presented to the clinic on the day of admission with
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was sent to the
emergency department from the clinic where she was found to
be saturating in the 90s on 100 percent nonrebreathing.  A
right sided thoracentesis was done with removal of 600 cc of
serous fluid which initially improved the patient's oxygen
saturation.  However, the patient subsequently desaturated
again on the nonrebreather requiring intubation.  The
patient's daughter reported that she has had increased
agitation and somnolence as well as green/[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum over
the past seven days.  She had been started on levofloxacin
without significant improvement in the sputum production.  On
the day prior to admission she developed increased somnolence
and lethargy prompting her visit to clinic.  She received
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Small cell lung cancer diagnosed in
[**2188**], status post radiation, chemotherapy, stem cell rescue,
prophylactic brain radiation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Hypothyroidism.

Atypical pneumonia.

Recurrent right pleural effusion.

Mental status changes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been married for 38 years.
Her daughter is a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 188**].  She is a former smoker and quit 70 pack years.  She
quit in [**2188**].  She denies any alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Is significant for mother diabetes and
father with hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Synthroid 100 mcg q.d., Celebrex,
Serevent, Atrovent, albuterol, home oxygen, levofloxacin 500
mg q.d.  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 98, blood
pressure 127/63, heart rate 126, respiratory rate 22,
saturating 90 percent on 100 percent non-rebreather.  In
general this is an ill appearing woman in respiratory
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination:
Mucous membranes slightly dry, extraocular movements intact.
Jugular venous distension was 6 cm.  Cardiac examination:
Tachycardic with a regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Lung examination:  Coarse breath sounds throughout
with decreased breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Neurologically alert and responsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission:  CBC revealed a white count
of 15.6 with 81 percent neutrophils, hematocrit was 39.1,
platelet count 321.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 137 with
potassium of 5.9, chloride of 93, bicarbonate of 38, BUN of
18, creatinine of 0.4 and glucose of 106.  Pleural fluid
showed 1335 white blood cells and [**Pager number 6326**] red blood cells.
Total protein was 4.1, glucose was 111 and albumin was 1.1.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 132 with normal
axis and normal [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  There were no ST or T wave
changes.  There were Q waves in 3 and AVF.  Chest x-ray
showed a large right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
collapse.  Her endotracheal tube was in place.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated in the
   emergency department.  Her respiratory failure was felt to
   be multifactorial with the pleural effusion and sizable
   lobar collapse playing a large role.  She was also treated
   for possible pneumonia and had bronchoscopy with BAL done
   on both [**5-10**] and [**5-11**].  BAL grew pansensitive pseudomonas
   and she was treated for this initially with ceftriaxone
   and azithromycin and then subsequently with ceftazidime to
   complete a 14 day course.  Given her underlying lung
   disease including bronchiectasis and severe chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, it was felt that she would
   likely have a long wean off the ventilator.  She therefore
   underwent tracheostomy on [**5-15**].  She was initially
   maintained on pressure controlled ventilation and was
   eventually able to be weaned from pressure support mode.
   She is currently tolerating 10 of pressure support with 5
   of PEEP and an FIO2 of 0.4.  On those settings she is
   pulling tidal volumes in the 300s and saturating 96 to 98
   percent.  We did consider chest tube placement to treat
   her effusion.  However, the patient was oxygenating and
   ventilating well and this was therefore deferred.

1. Pneumonia:  As stated above patient was felt to likely
   have an underlying pneumonia as the source of her acute
   decompensation.  She was treated with ceftazidine for
   pseudomonas pneumonia and will complete a 14 day course.
   She also received chest physical therapy and suctioning
   p.r.n.

1. Small cell lung cancer:  Cytology from both her BAL and
   from her pleural fluid were negative for malignant cells.
   At this time there is no evidence of disease recurrence.

1. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on her home
   dose of Synthroid.  Given her persistent tachycardia a TSH
   and free T4 were checked and are pending at the time of
   this dictation.

1. Tachycardia:  The patient was persistently tachycardic
   throughout her admission.  This was initially felt to be
   secondary to volume depletion.  However, this did not
   resolve with intravenous fluids.  She underwent an
   echocardiogram which showed depressed left ventricular
   ejection fraction and was started on an ACE inhibitor for
   afterload reduction.  As mentioned above thyroid function
   tests were also checked given her history of
   hypothyroidism and are currently pending.

1. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had a
   Dobhoff tube placed and has been on tube feeds since
   admission.  A speech and swallow evaluation is pending.

1. Metabolic alkalosis:  This is felt to be compensatory for
   the patient's primary respiratory acidosis from her
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  A urine chloride
   was checked and was 112 suggesting that her metabolic
   alkalosis was not chloride responsive.

1. Access:  Patient had a right subclavian vein and right
   radial arterial line which were both discontinued prior to
   discharge.  A PICC line was placed by Interventional
   Radiology.

1. Prophylaxis:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
   heparin, Venodynes and proton pump inhibitor.

1. Hyperglycemia:  The patient was on an insulin sliding
   scale with good glycemic control throughout her admission.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Respiratory failure.
2. History of small cell lung cancer.
3. Recurrent pneumonia, now pseudomonas.
4. Recurrent right pleural effusion.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Hypothyroidism.

AP ERECT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST (on admission): A PICC
is seen with the tip in the superior vena cava. Interval
development of interstitial pulmonary edema. There is discoid
atelectasis at the right lung base. No pleural effusions are
apparent. The heart size is within normal limits. IMPRESSION:
Interval development of pulmonary edema.  Discoid atelectasis at
the right lung base.
.
CHEST CT to R/O PE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral patchy opacities represent asymmetric pulmonary
edema versus
multifocal pneumonia.  Clinical correlation recommended.  No
evidence for PE.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis and very small bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
EKG on admission:
Sinus rhythm, Probable old anteroseptal infarct. Since previous
tracing, no significant change

Brief Hospital Course:
59F with osteomyelitis, s/p ant-inf MI s/p stent to pLAD, CHF
with EF 20-25%, was admitted intially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with CHF
exacerbation and then called out from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**6-25**] to [**Hospital1 **] service
for further work-up and treatment.
.
# CHF exacerbation: Patient was hypoxic on admission with
pulmonary edema on CXR, so was intubated and diuresed in ICU;
given her known EF = 20-25%, CHF was the most likely cause of
her dyspnea. No apparent cause for the acute exacerbation could
be identified; patient denies any dietary indiscretion, cardiac
enzymes were negative and EKG was unchanged from prior. PE was
also considered as a cause of her dyspnea, and given an elevated
D dimer, CTA of the chest was performed which did not identify
any PE. After 24 hours of ventilatory support and aggressive
diuresis, she was able to be extubated and transferred to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 telemetry [**Hospital1 **].
.
At the time of transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], patient appeared clinically
normovolemic. She was gently diuresed to slightly below her home
dry weight of 95lbs. She was started on metoprolol and
lisinopril was added once her creatinine had stabilized.
.
# Hct drop: From 28-21 with no evidence of active bleeding -
guiac negative. Patient received 2 units of PRBC in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior
to transfer with appropriate response, Hct stable thereafter.
Heme consult reviewed peripheral smear with no concerning
findings. Does not appear to be a consumptive process--no signs
of hemolysis on lab work. Iron studies c/w anemia of
inflammation. Acute change in Hct during acute pulmonary edema
appears to have resulted from fluid volume shifts.
.
# WBC drop: 9.1 to 2.3 on [**6-26**], gradually increased to 4.8 on
[**6-29**] without intervention. Unclear etiology; lymphocyte
predominant with a monocytosis suggestive of toxin-mediated bone
marrow suppression. Heme consult suspects drug reaction,
possibly levafloxacin, which was given in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and has been
reported to cause agranulocytosis. HIV infection can also cause
leukopenia, although patient denies high-risk behaviors such as
unprotected sex with anyone other than husband or IVDA, she
consented to be tested for HIV and test results pending.
.
# Short runs of WCT, asymptomatic: EP consulted and felt that
emergent ICD placement was not indicated given current
comorbidities. Had a negative V-Stim at [**Hospital1 112**] [**2145-12-17**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (EF 20-25% at that time). Pt. wants to avoid ICD if
possible. Continued beta blocker therapy should decrease the
incidence of the NSVT/WCT.
.
# Anxiety/depression: Patient says she has had a psychiatrist
for many years and used to take valium with good effect. Her new
doctor, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 47716**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 108658**], stopped benzos b/c she had
a history of abusing the valium and started prozac plus
neurontin. [**6-27**] patient expressed SI and was seen by in-house
psychiatry consult, who felt patient was not at risk to self and
did not need 1:1 sitter but recommended treating her significant
anxiety with resperidone and uptitrating neurontin. However,
patient had symptomatic hypotension after first dose risperidone
1mg, but patient said she slept well and felt much better the
morning after the risperidone, so restarted risperidone at
0.25mg hs prn. Continued home dose of fluoxetine 60 mg po and
gabapentin 300mg tid as recommended per psych. Patient will see
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] to adjust outpatient anti-anxiety and anti-depressant
regimen next week.
.
# Substance abuse: Pt admits to smoking marijuana daily and has
history of abusing diazepam. Social work consulted to discuss
coping mechanisms with patient. They recommended, as did
psychiatry consult, that patient go to day treatment center such
as [**Doctor First Name 1191**] Day Center for ongoing substance, which psychiatry
recommended is best arranged through her outpatient psychiatrist
for continuity.
.
# Osteomyelitis - Receiving cefazolin via home pump. Per
podiatry notes, still needs 3 more weeks, so D/C'd with
prescription to continue through [**7-19**] to completely treat
osteomyelitis of L great toe. Pt has home IV nursing who
maintains PICC line and helps her with Abx infusions; will
contact the agency before discharge to reinitiate their
services.
.
# Hyponatremia - serum osms low, so hypoosmolar, hypervolemic
hyponatremia upon presentation to ER, likely CHF as etiology.
Resolved steadily with diuresis and sodium normal at 133 on the
morning of discharge.

History of Present Illness:
84 yo F with severe COPD, asthma, HTN, steroid induced
hyperglycemia, and VRE recently discharged on [**2169-8-1**] for a left
lower lobe pneumonia who presented to her pulmonary f/u
appointment with increased SOB, and 13 pound weight gain (Lasix
dose decreased in hospital given rising creatinine).
.
Patient reports that since discharge, her breathing has worsened
and her legs have swelled up significantly. Additionally, she
reports that her breathing has gotten much worse at home
(patient on home O2, discharged with O2 for sat of 88% on room
air on day of discharge). Finally, patient reports that she has
no history of diabetes but began to have sugars to the 500s on
steroids during her last hospitalization and she was sent home
with SQ insulin during her prednisone taper.

Asthma in her father

Physical Exam:
BP 125/61, HR 106-115, RR 30-34, O2 Sat 97% on 3L
Gen: older female in NAD
HEENT: clear oral pharynx, dry MM
CV: RRR 2/6 SM at RUSB
Lungs: scattered wheezes and rhonchi especially around right
lung fields
Abd: soft, NT, +BD, +distended
Extrem: +[**11-28**] pitting edema bilat to thigh with skin color
changes
Skin: right flank area with non blanching erythmatous rash with
few blisters in a dermatomal distribution, does not cross
midline.


Pertinent Results:
CXR: 9//14/06
IMPRESSION: Interval volume loss in the right middle lobe that
could
represent infiltrate, atelectasis, or neoplasia compressing the
right middle bronchus. Persistent left lower lobe opacity
obscuring the hemidiaphragm and cardiac silhouette.
.
[**2169-8-14**]:
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Barium passes freely through the esophagus.
There was an episodes of aspiration into the [**Last Name (un) **] heaa which did
not elicit spontaneous cough . No structural abnormalities were
detected in the region of the pharynx and cervical esophagus.
There are tertiary peristaltic contractions and mild dilatation
of the esophagus. There is a small axial hiatal hernia and a
small degree of GE reflux was observed.
IMPRESSION:
1. Axial hiatal hernia and GE reflux.
2. Nonspecific motor disorder of esophagus
3. Episode of aspiration with no spontaneous cough
.
ECHO [**2169-8-11**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course: 84 y/o F with h/o COPD, asthma, HTN,
recent LLL pneumonia, who presents with increased dyspnea.  Pt
was admitted to the medical ICU with dyspnea SOB.  She was
initially found to have a RML lung collapse: No fever,
leukocytosis to support infectious etiology, and recently
completed 2 week course of levofloxacin. Therefore held off on
further antibiotics innitially. Suspected collapse secondary to
aspiration. Barium swallow confirmed silent aspiration into the
airways. Aggressive chest physical therapy, nebulizers, and
aspiration precautions undertaken to help prevent further
aspiration and recruit atelectatic lung. [**Month (only) 116**] need PEG for
nutritional support given her ongoing aspiration, but patient
declined. Video swallow study and nutrition consult for further
evaluation displayed gross aspiration.  An attempt was made to
transfer the patient to the floor, upon arrival she became
tachypneic and tachycardic with labored breathing and was
returned to the MICU.  Pt was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn to
complete a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.  She
responded well clinically.  Pt was discharged NPO and was
receiving nutirition via an NG tube.

to 101.7, hypotensive in the 70s/30s, and tachypneic. He was
intubated for "" hypoxic resp distress""; no ABG. His hematocrit
was 17 there (unclear prior HCT), and he was having melena. His
INR was 2.9. He received 2 L IVF, 2 U PRBCs, clindamycin and

of presumed aspiration pneumonia.  PEG lavage was neg. HD
stable. He received a total of 7 units P RBCs (2 at the OSH, 5
here) and FFP x3 units. GI was consulted and becuase of
elevation of INR, did not scope.  An EGD was discussed with the
patient and he refused.  This was reviewed with his HCP.  On

   WOUND CULTURE (Pending):


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old man with Parkinson's and chronic aspiration who
presents with GI bleed and sepsis.
.
#. Multilobar pneumonia/SIRS:  The patient was intubated at the
OSH for hypoxia per their reports.  A chest x-ray on admission
showed bilateral focal airspace opacities.  Sputum was positive
for MRSA at OSH and here.  He was started on vancomycin and
zosyn for broadspectrum coverage of nosocomial pneumonia, and
started on a sepsis protocol with aggresive IVF rehydration,
transfusions and transient use of levophed.  He was successfully
extubated on [**6-24**], but found to be tachypneic.  A repeat CXR
showed worsened pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions right > left.  This was felt to be secondary to his
aggressive fluid resuccitation and transfusion with 5 units of
RBCs here + 2 units of RBCs at the OSH + 3 units of FFP here.
On transfer from the MICU, he was positive 5.5 L for length of
stay.  He was diuresed aggressively ~ 1 L per day for 2 days
with a marked improvement in his pulmonary edema and bilateral
pleural effusions, but with continued multifocal opacities
bilaterally.   He may benefit from occasional diuresis with
20-40 mg PO lasix.  His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to
vancomycin, and he was started on flagyl to cover for anaerobes
given his history of chronic aspiration.  His WBC trended down
and he remained afebrile.  He had occasional desaturations, but
these resolved with aggressive chest PT and expectoration of
large mucus plugs.  On the day of discharge, he was switched to
vancomycin and levofloxacin for broader coverage of gram
negative organisms, given his recent hospital stays.  The flagyl
was discontinued as it was felt that his lack of teeth made
anaerobes less likely a factor in his pneumonia.  A PICC line
was placed on the day of discharge for administration of his
vancomycin, but he pulled this out accidentally because he was
curious how it worked.  A repeat PICC was placed on the day of
discharge and is ready for use.
.
#. GI bleed: The patient was noted to have frank melena on
admission.  His INR was found to be elevated to 2.1 on admission
secondary to coumadin therapy for his atrial fibrillation.  His
hematocrit at the OSH was reportedly 18, with a baseline
hematocrit in [**12-22**] at 39 per VA records.  He had received 2
units of pRBCs at the OSH with an improvement in his hematocrit
to 20.9 on admission.  He was transfused with 3 units of FFP for
emergent INR reversal as well as another 5 units of pRBCs.  An
NG lavage was not performed in the ED secondary to difficulty
with passing an NG tube.  However, a lavage through his PEG tube
was negative.  Gi was consulted and was planning to perform an
EGD on him while he was intubated, but he and his family refused
the test at that time.  On transfer to the floor, an EGD was
pursued again, but his respiratory status was felt to be too
poor to pursue an EGD without intubation.  He may benefit from
an elective EGD once his respiratory status has completely
improved.  He had a recent colonoscopy at the VA which showed
multiple polyps but was otherwise negative for a source of
bleeding.  His hematocrit steadily increased after transfer to
the floor out of the MICU, and was 34.2 at time of discharge.
He will need to continue on lansoprazole 30 mg per G-tube Q12.
.
#. CAD:  The patient did not appear to be having active ischemia
and never complained of chest pain.  His EKG at the OSH showed
ST depressions in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and
hct 17.  These were resolved on ECG. He was ruled out for an MI
with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  He was restarted on
aspirin 81 mg QD and started on metoprolol which was titrated up
to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], and restarted on simvastatin at 20 mg QHS.  He
should be restarted on an ACE-I as an outpatient if he remains
hypertensive.
.
#. Atrial Fibrillation:  He has chronic atrial fibrillation, and
was on amiodarone on admission.  His INR was reversed with FFP
and vitamin K, and his coumadin was held secondary to his GI
bleed.  Per old records, he had been evaluated by a cardiologist
earlier in the year and the decision had been made to rate
control him, but avoid anticoagulation given his past history of
falls and antral gastritis.  He should not be restarted on
coumadin, given his clear propensity to bleed.  He will be
continued on a baby aspirin for CVA prophylaxis.  His amiodarone
was discontinued because of his history of restrictive lung
disease secondary to asbestos exposure and because he did not
appear to have any rhythm benefit from it.  Additionally, he had
no symptomatic benefit from it.  Instead, he was restarted on
metoprolol, and this was titrated up to his outpatient dose of
50 mg [**Hospital1 **] with good rate control.  This may be titrated up as an
outpatient as tolerated by his blood pressure.
.
#. Parkinson's: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration
secondary to gradual deterioration from his parkinson's disease.
 He has a PEG tube in place and was continued on his tube feeds.
 He was continued on carbidopa-levodopa and requip.
.
#. Low anion gap: The patient was found to have a low anion gap
of 5.  A serum calcium level was normal, and the total protein
to albumin ratio was found to be 5.7/2.2, which was not
especially high.  He could be further worked up as an outpatient
with an SPEP and UPEP to screen for multiple myeloma, though his
UA had only trace protein and he has no bone pain.
.
#. Anemia - The patient has a history of myelodysplasia and
chronic Vitamin B12 deficiency.  Baseline hct at OSH was 39 in
[**12-22**].  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease, and he had a normal Vitamin B12 level and folate during
this admission.  He was restarted on his outpatient dose of
cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg PO QD.
.
#. Hematuria - The patient was noted to have microscopic
hematuria on this admission, which was followed by macroscopic
hematuria seen in his foley after he was seen to pull on his
foley.  Given his elevated INR, this was felt to be due to foley
trauma.  However, he should have a follow-up urinalysis as an
outpatient to evaluate for hematuria, and may need an outpatient
work-up.  He will be discharged with his foley in place, and
will need a voiding trial at his [**Hospital1 1501**].

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
PO assessment was conducted with ice chips, water and nectar
thick liquid via tsp, cup and straw sip, custard, applesauce and

whole & crushed meds in applesauce and one bite of ground up
[**Location (un) **] crackers in custard. Swallows were slow / delayed.
Laryngeal elevation felt adequate to palpation. There was no
cough, no throat clear and no change in voice quality after
eating or drinking. However, the pt. consistently said that she
felt like coughing after drinking water. She said she did not
feel like coughing after drinking nectar thick liquids. We were
unable to obtain a reliable O2 saturation despite trying on her
finger, toe or ear. She seemed to swallow ground and pureed
solids but did best when she alternated between bites and sips.

She could not swallow the whole pill w/nectar or in applesauce.

So, we crushed the pill in custard and swallowed it with a sip
of
nectar to follow.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1661**] may be aspirating thin liquids because she says
she feel like coughing consistently after drinking water.
However, she appears safe to drink nectar thick liquids and to
eat pureed or ground solids if she alternates between bites and
sips. She could not swallow a whole pill today with nectar thick

[**Location (un) 2452**] juice or whole in applesauce, but she swallowed her pill
crushed in custard w/a sip of nectar to follow.
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of Level 4, Mild to moderate
dysphagia with 2 consistnecy restrictions and intermittent
supervision/cueing. This dysphagia is likely due to her old
strokes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Diet of ground solids and Nectar thick liquids with
Pills crushed in puree

2. Supervision w/meals
Alternate between bites and sips

3. If there are further concerns about aspiration on this diet,
we would be happy to perform a FEES evaluation. She would
not be a candidate for a Videoswallow because she is too
large to fit into the fluoroscope.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and
medical team.

FINDINGS: Compared with 5/16 and with [**2125-5-29**], haziness at the
right lung base is consistent with the right pleural effusion
seen on CT of [**6-2**] and does not appear grossly changed.

The left hemidiaphragm is elevated compared with the pre-op
study consistent the left lower lobe collapse on CT. The
superimposed left pleural effusion appears perhaps slightly
smaller.

The known right innominate artery aneurysm and recent aortic
stent graft are again noted. No overt CHF.

IMPRESSION: Overall, no definite/obvious significant interval
changes appreciated.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: r/o leak

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
64 year old woman with s/p aortic reconstruction
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o leak
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 64-year-old woman post aortic reconstruction, evaluate
for leak.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector contiguous axial images of the neck and
chest were obtained following the administration of intravenous
contrast. Delayed images of the neck through the chest were
obtained. Non-contrast study of the chest was also obtained.

FINDINGS: Compared to prior study of [**2125-5-4**], there has
been repair of the aneurysmal dilatation of the innominate
artery. Stent graft is seen extending from the distal portion of
the ascending thoracic aorta through the arch and through the
proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta. No leak is
identified.

Injection of contrast was performed via the left arm, and there
are a large amount of collaterals seen extending along the
posterior chest wall to the azygos and hemiazygos veins which
enter the right atrium via the IVC. The SVC, and proximal left
subclavian vein are thrombosed in the interval.

There are no filling defects in the pulmonary arterial
vasculature. No pulmonary embolism is identified. At the site of
surgical clips in the left upper neck, there is a large hematoma
measuring 3.6 x 6.8 cm.

Lung windows demonstrate atelectasis of the left lower lobe,
moderate and to a lesser degree on the right. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are present.

Few images through the upper abdomen demonstrate a simple cyst
arising from the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 5.5 cm
in diameter. A calcified granuloma is seen in the spleen.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Bridges on [**2125-6-2**].

IMPRESSION:
1. No leak post aortic reconstruction.
2. No pulmonary embolism.
3. Left neck hematoma as described above.
4. Interval development of thrombosis of the superior vena cava
and proximal left subclavian vein.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**5-3**] to vascular service for left leg venous stasis
ulcers which was infected, she was sterted on IV antibiotics and
VAC placed [**5-4**].  She was worked up for mass that was
compressing trachea that revealed innominate artery aneurysm.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and she underwent preoperative
workup.  She underwent recontruction and bypass of aneurysm in
two phase on [**5-22**] and [**5-23**], see operative report for further
details.  She was transferred to the CSRU and requiring pressors
for blood pressure management. She awoke neurologically intact
and over the next few days was weaned off pressors and
diuresised.  She extubated on [**5-28**] without complications and
continued to progress.  She remained in the CSRU for respiratory
and blood pressure monitoring.  She had swallowing evaluation
due to concerns for aspiration that she did well and was cleared
for nectar thickended.  She was started on anticoagulation for
thrombosis Rt subclavian.  She continued to do well and was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 on [**6-4**] for continued treatment.  She
continued to work with physical therapy and was ready for
discharge to rehab.

Service:  TRAUMA

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pedestrian hit by a car.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old
Portugese speaking man who, at his baseline, has hypertension
and noninsulin dependent diabetes who was struck by a car
while he was walking across the street.  There was a reported
loss of consciousness for minutes at the scene and he was
rushed to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency
Room.  On arrival, the patient was awake with occasional
vomiting.  He has an obvious right lower extremity deformity.
He was agitated in the Trauma Bay and his obvious complaint
was right leg pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes
3.  History of right leg sciatica

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Avandia 8 q a.m.
2.  Glucophage 500 tid
3.  Atenolol 50 tid
4.  Neurontin 650 q hs
5.  Vioxx 25 q hs

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of ethanol or tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.8??????, pulse 76, pressure 168/86,
respirations in the 20s, O2 saturation 99%.
GENERAL:  There are several superficial abrasions on the
face.  He has right greater than left periorbital ecchymosis.
NECK:  Nontender.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
RECTAL:  Good tone, heme negative.
EXTREMITIES:  He moves upper extremities bilaterally and left
lower extremity.  The right extremity has deformity at the
proximal tibial level.
NEUROLOGIC:  On arrival, he is awake and alert and oriented
x3 and follows simple three step commands.

LABORATORIES:  Last white count 15, hematocrit 35.6,
platelets 270.  Urinalysis is nitrite negative, no bacteria
and 8 white cells with Foley catheter.  Electrolytes:  Sodium
137, potassium 4.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 26, BUN 29,
creatinine 0.9, glucose of 132.  Urine culture shows no
growth on [**2-19**].

RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:  Head CT on [**2141-2-8**] showed several
small foci of parenchymal hemorrhage.  This was in the
posterior temporal lobes, right posterior parietal lobe, left
posterior frontal lobe and right posterior temporal lobe.
There is a small subarachnoid component to the hemorrhage in
the right posterior temporal lobe.  There is no shift of
midline structures.  Repeat CT on [**2-9**] and [**2-18**]
show no significant change and definitely no increase in
hemorrhage.  There is no midline shift.

CT sinus on [**2141-2-18**] show mild sinusitis involving the
sphenoid and right maxillary and frontal sinus.  This is
overall improved from the prior studies.

IVC filter placed successfully [**2141-2-15**].

On [**2141-2-20**], a previously placed percutaneous gastric
feeding tube was changed to percutaneous gastrojejunal
feeding tube on [**2-20**] successfully.

MRI of cervical spine shows no evidence of misalignment or
soft tissue edema.

Right tibia fibula shows a comminuted proximal tibial
fracture which is now status post open reduction internal
fixation.

CT cervical spine is negative for fractures.

Chest x-ray shows small pleural effusion of the left with no
infiltrates.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **], after his
trauma, was admitted for care of his right tibial fracture
and intraparenchymal hemorrhages.  Due to his agitation, he
was kept sedated in the Intensive Care Unit.  An orthopedic
and neurosurgery consult was obtained.  His hospital course
will be described by systems as below.

1.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Neurosurgical evaluation of small
intraparenchymal hemorrhages was deemed nonsurgical and Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was observed throughout his hospital course.  His
spine was cleared and he is now able to be moved out of bed
for physical therapy.  His hemorrhages were stable on repeat
CT scans and his neurological status is closely followed for
self improvement.  Over the hospital course, his neurological
status has steadily improved.  On discharge, however, he is
still somnolent and at baseline moans on physical stimulus.
He does not answer any questions.  He is more alert when the
family is around.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained stable throughout
his hospital course and now is on Lopressor and captopril for
his hypertension control.  His pre-hospitalization medication
was atenolol which was changed to Lopressor during admission.
His atenolol dose is higher than his Lopressor dose at 50 tid
and thus Lopressor dose may be increased or switched to
atenolol as deemed necessary.

3.  RESPIRATORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated relatively easily
postoperative of his tibial fracture repair.  During his
hospital course, however, he has had difficulty clearing his
secretions and is therefore on aspiration precautions.  He
was once transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for a
question of aspiration while he was on the tube feeds,
however no evidence of aspiration was found.  Currently, he
is on NPO status and receives tube feeds.  He appears
comfortable and in no respiratory distress at his baseline.
He will need aggressive chest PT to prevent pneumonia.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **], over the hospital course,
has been easily advanced tube feeds at goal.  He currently
has a PEJ tube which was placed percutaneously.  He receives
free water boluses for additional hydration.  At discharge,
he is tolerating tube feeds, having bowel movements.

5.  RENAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had normal creatinine and is
making adequate urine at discharge.  He makes more than 1
liter of urine a day through his Foley catheter.  He is a
candidate for a switch of his Foley catheter to a condom
catheter upon discharge.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Although there was a question of
aspiration pneumonia, there were no clinical signs of this
while Mr. [**Known lastname **] was observed during his hospitalization.
Currently, he is on 10 days of Kefzol with the last dose on
[**2141-2-25**].  This was started due to erythema at his
incision site on the right tibial open reduction internal
fixation location.  This side has improved significantly in
erythema over time and now has some residual bruising at the
site.  The incision on discharge is clean, dry and intact.

7.  ORTHOPEDICS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is status post open reduction
internal fixation of his proximal right tibial fracture done
on [**2141-2-10**].  His postoperative course has been
significant for some erythema at the wound which is
significantly improved and has since started on Kefzol.  He
has received knee films on [**2-23**] to follow up for his
repair.  These films show no apparent change in the stability
of his reduction.  He is in a knee immobilizer at present and
tolerates passive motion exercises.  He has a blister on his
right lower extremity likely related to pressure from his
motion machine.  He will need local care for this blister.
He will follow up with orthopedics for his open reduction
internal fixation.

8.  HEME:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had a stable hematocrit through his
hospitalization.

9.  DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS PROPHYLAXIS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] received
an IVC filter during his hospitalization to prevent pulmonary
embolus.  He is currently on heparin subcutaneous to prevent
deep venous thromboses.

10. ENDOCRINE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **]' blood sugars have been reasonably
controlled with sliding scale insulin and now on Glucophage
500 tid.  He receives minimal occasional insulin sliding
scale coverage to achieve tighter control.

11. PHYSICAL THERAPY:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is able to sit in a chair
when moved with assist.  He will require aggressive physical
therapy to improve his status.  He is full weight bearing
status.  He will however require significant physical therapy
for his right tibial fracture repair.

In summary on discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is somnolent and
non-conversive.  He is tolerating tube feeds at goal.  He
requires chest PT for prevention of pneumonia.  He is having
bowel movements.  He has a Foley catheter which can be
changed to condom catheter.  He requires passive physical
therapy to his right leg, status post repair of his fracture
and he is allowed to get out of bed with assist.  Follow up
trauma clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 274**] in two to four weeks post
discharge, with Orthopedics, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13469**], at [**Hospital1 **] two weeks post discharge.

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 46yo man with a h/o HCV, HTN, heavy EtOH
abuse, dilated alcoholic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), and bilateral
cavitary pulmonary lesions who was BIBA after drinking a large
quantity of EtOH. He had recently been admitted to [**Hospital 7302**] for EtOH withdrawal on the evening of
[**2102-5-1**] but left AMA. He then called his girlfriend after
consuming a large amount of EtOH, who called the EMS. On
presentation, he c/o chest pain, chronic SOB and cough, was
found to be hypertensive to 260/166 with HR 110. In the ED he
was given ASA 325, SL NTG, and IV Nitro for 10 mins, thiamine,
folic acid, mvi, and ativan 2 mg. His EtOH level was 420. He was
seen by cardiology for ?ST elevations. A bedside echo was
limited but revealed likley mild global HK. He ruled out for an
MI with 3 negative sets of cardiac enzymes. He was admitted
initially to the floor but then sent to the MICU for symptoms
consistent with etoh withdrawal. He was continued on valium per
CIWA, restarted on his listed BP meds but his SBP then dropped
and so his lisinopril was decreased.
.
Pt is currently without complaints, says that he feels he is ""on
the upswing"" and ""should be ready to go by the end of the week.""
He is requesting transfer to a rehabilitation upon discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**].

Echo [**5-2**]: The study is limited by poor acoustic windows. The
left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular wall motion is difficult to assess but
is probably globally mildly depressed. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. Mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. If
clinically indicated, a repeat transthoracic study by a
son[**Name (NI) 930**] with possible contrast administration for
endocardial definition may be helpful.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo M with HCV, HTN, EtOH abuse, dilated alcoholic CMY (EF
25%), admitted with EtOH intox.  Hosp course by problem:
.
# EtOH withdrawal: He has a known h/o EtOH withdrawel w
seizures.  When he first arrived on the floor, he required very
high dosages of valium (up to 140 per day).  Thus, he was
briefly transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.  He did
well in the ICU and was transferred back to the floor.  There
his CIWA scale was initially in the 15-20 range and improved
with valium (up to 100 per day).  The patient was seen by
psychiatry and we put him on a strict valium taper.  He
tolerated this fairly well over the course of several days.  He
did have anxiety as below which likely lengthened the valium
taper.  We had the patient evaluated by case management as well
as social work and psych placement services to assess for
outpatient withdrawal/recovery services.  However, quite
abruptly, the patient decided he needed to make an appointment
on [**5-9**].  We would not prescribe a [**Month/Day (4) **] upon discharge but
instead wrote for a short course of seroquel.  He was aware of
the fact that we might have had placement for him within a few
days but refused such an investigation.
.
# Hypothyroid: patient reported good compliance with synthroid
as an outpatient (although did not take any other meds).  His
TSH was high so we increased the synthroid.  We recommend
followup TSH in [**3-7**] weeks.
.
# HTN: likely combination of withdrawal and noncompliance with
home regimen.  we restarted his home meds and he did well.
However, on [**5-5**], he had assymptomatic hypotension with systolic
in the 80s which responded to IVF.  We decreased his lisinopril
with good effect.
.
# CV:
a) Coronaries: no known CAD; ruled out for MI by enzymes;
continued ASA 81 mg daily for ppx.  While in the ICU, he did
have a brief episode of chest pain which was not accompanied by
EKG changes or any elevation in enzymes.
b) Dilated CMY (EF 25%): appears euvolemic to slightly dry.
- cont outpt lasix and spironalactone doses, watched fluid
status and followed renal function.  Did well.
- cont outpt digoxin for inotropy
.
# Transaminitis: likely from HCV plus etoh toxicity. LFT's at
baseline per report. Pt unlikely to be a candidate for treatment
with interferon given significant psychiatric and behavioral
comordities
- counselled about the importance of abstaining from any further
etoh
- hep B serologies as above
.
# Anxiety: multiple life stressors, including girlfriend out of
town and apparent movie deal involving patient and his family
- social work assisted with his care.  psychiatry also saw
patient and helped with the valium taper.  We were however
reluctant to prescribe benzos upon dispo which is why we used
many resources to search for a detox center, which he refused.
- pt had an appt with a psychiatrist as an outpatient on [**5-29**]
per his report; We contact[**Name (NI) **] the facility prior to discharge and
were unable to move the appointment to a closer date.

.
[**2150-1-31**] CXR:
Compared with one day earlier, the right suprahilar patchy
opacity is more extensive and patchy opacity in the right
cardiophrenic region is also more pronounced. However, I doubt
the presence of upper zone redistribution or significant CHF.
Minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region and right is
unchanged. No effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Doubt CHF. More extensive patchy opacities in the
right perihilar and right cardiophrenic regions.
.
[**2150-1-31**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis
of the right or left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo female with history of afib with SSS on coumadin, HTN,
hyperlipidemia who presents from ALF with worsening dyspnea,
treated in MICU for NSTEMI, CHF and PNA.
.
# NSTEMI:  In the setting of her acute illness the patient
suffered an NSTEMI with Trop increasing from <.01 to peak of
0.77, since trending downward. Cardiology was consulted with
recommendation to treat comorbidities and maximize med regimen
without likely plan for cath. However, given NSTEMI exacerbated
by afib with RVR and history of likely tachy-brady, EP consulted
as well. Patient is currently well rate controlled with
Metoprolol with potential plan for PPM at some point in future.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial including PNA, CHF.  In the
MICU, the patient initially required BiPap for resp distress.
She was subsequently diuresed and started on broad spectrum
coverage abx (Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl) given fever on admission and
course pulmonary exam. With above treatment patient's fever
curve improved as did her resp status.  Antibiotics were then
narrowed to levofloxacin and she will complete a 14 day course
to finish on [**2150-2-16**].  Of note, she did have LLE swelling on
admission which has since resolved, but LENIs neg for DVT.
.
# CHF: Echo done in [**8-20**] with EF >70. Likely [**1-16**] diastolic
dysfunction.  She was initially diuresed aggressively, but her
diuretics were discontinued when she appeared clinically
euvolemic, if not mildly dry [**1-16**] to decreased PO intake.  Her
fluid status will need to be continually addressed while in
rehab with reinitiation of her diuretics as needed accordingly.
.
#. Pneumonia: was on vanc/zosyn/azithro in ICU for LLL opacity
on CXR. Changed to levaquin PO for ? CAP/asp.  She was not
covered for hospital acquired infection (gram negatives and
MRSA), but doubt that based on clinical status and CXR findings.
 She has remained afebrile without leukocytosis since initiation
of abx.  Her pulmonary exam remains rhonchorus and she has not
been able to clear her secretions well.  Chest PT was initiated
with improvement in her O2 saturation on room air.  Aggressive
pulmonary toilet should be continued in rehab as well.  If
clinical status were to deteriorate, broadening antibiotic
coverage to include hospital acquired infections is very
reasonable given her multiple hospital and rehab admissions.
Respiratory and blood cultures were negative.  She is to
complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin on [**2150-2-16**].  She was
maintaining oxygen saturations in the low to mid 90s (increasing
to high 90s with chest PT) at time of discharge.
.
#. COPD: likely experiencing exacerbation [**1-16**] pneumonia.
Although predominantly rhonchorus on exam, she did have
intermittent wheezing.  She was continued on advair,
albuterol/atrovent nebulizers, which have improved her
bronchospastic symptoms and exam findings.
.
#. CAD: Patient with troponin elevation, peak 0.77 and
subsequent downward trend. Likely a demand picture in setting of
afib with RVR, PNA, and CHF with resultant hypoxia in the unit.
She was started on plavix for anticipated cath but no plan for
that currently so it was discontinued.  She will be continued on
ASA and statin for discharge.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Known history of a. fib with history of
likely SSS, previously requiring temporary pacing.  Had 2
episodes of A-fib w/ RVR on [**2-5**], which were largely
unresponsive to IV lopressor, but broke with diltiazem 10-20 mg
IV.  She will be continued on PO metoprolol at 50mg QID.  Her
coumadin was originally held for the potential of PPM placement
by EP.  However, given her pulmonary status currently, there are
holding on PPM placement currently.  She does, however, have
outpatient follow up with EP on [**2150-4-15**] at which time this will
be readdressed.  Currently, she remains on heparin gtt and will
be restarted on coumadin.  Weight based heparin gtt (as included
in discharge paperwork) can be discontinued when her INR is
again therapeutic, but this will need to be followed in rehab.
.
#.  Hematuria:  While on the heparin gtt, she developed
hematuria via her foley 1 day prior to admission.  There were no
clots.  Hct and HD were entirely stable in this setting.  Her
foley catheter was discontinued and her UA did not reveal
evidence of infection.  She was able to void without difficulty
and she denied urinary symptoms.  A urine cx is currently
pending and should be followed up.  She should call [**Hospital1 18**]
urology at([**Telephone/Fax (1) 772**] for a follow up appointment to further
evaluate this if persists.
.
#. Anemia: baseline HCT 25-30.  Stable throughout hospital
course.  Should be monitored at rehab given anticoagulation and
recent hematuria.
.
#. ARF:  She had a very mild bump in her creatinine to 1.2 (BL
creatinine nml) just prior to discharge and clinically on exam
appeared to be dry with dry MM.  Creatinine normalized on day of
d/c to 1.0 after small IV fluid bolus.  Prior to her creatinine
bump, she had been kept NPO for the potential PPM placement.
Her diet has since been restarted and she was given a small
fluid bolus (given known CHF and recent aggressive diuresis).
Her kidney function and fluid status should be monitored at
rehab as well.
.
#. Depression:  She was continued on Celexa per her outpatient
regimen.
.
#. FEN:  Low sodium, heart healthy diet, ground, thick liquids.
Given concern for aspiration pneumonia, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow twice during this stay and was cleared to
take PO (ground and thin liquids) diet without evidence of
aspiration.
.
#  On [**2150-2-10**], primary team was notified that patient had a bed
at [**Hospital 100**] rehab and she was discharged there.  However, upon
arrival to [**Hospital 100**] rehab, transport team was informed that there
was no bed available.  Thus, she was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**]
in the care of original team and nursing staff.  She was
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2150-2-11**].

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2126-5-10**]:
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system.
The RCA had a long 60% mid vessel lesion and was totally
occluded in the
mid to distal vesel with left to right collaterals to the distal
vessel.
The LMCA had a 60% distal lesion. The LAD had a 70% mid vessel
lesion.
The D1 had a 70% lesion. The LCX had a 70% ostial lesion. The
first
major OM had a 80% lesion.
  2. Hemodynamics post PCI showed normal central pressure,
mildly
elevated left sided filling pressures, and a normal cardiac
index.
  3. After the export catheter was used during the procedure,
the
patient had a bradycardic episode to HR 32 with decreased blood
pressure
- which required atropine. Pacer was introduced, but patient did
not
require pacing.
  4. Successful Primary PCI of the RCA with two overlapping
Cypher DES
(3.5 x 33 mm, post-dilated with a 4.0 mm balloon, and 3.0 x 33
mm,
post-dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI of
the
RCA.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate
([**2-10**]+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the inferior wall and hypokinesis of the
infero-septum and infero-lateral walls. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61yo M former tob smoker with family history of early CAD
who presents with STEMI s/p cath with 3VD and PCI of RCA.
.
1.  CV:
A).  Coronaries: Pt presented to OSH with chest pain and was
found to have an STEMI.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], where he
underwent urgent cardiac catheterization.  The cath demonstrated
left main and 3v CAD and the patient underwent a PCI of RCA
which was thought to be the culprit lesion based on angiographic
findings.  After his cardiac catheterization, he was monitored
on telemetry and managed medically.  He was initially ordered
for metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which was subsequently held and then
d/c'd due to bradycardia.  He was started on ACEI which he
tolerated as well as ASA and Plavix.  He was also given lipitor
80mg QHS initially, but this was also stopped due to elevated
LFT.  The patient requires a repeat LFT and Cholesterol panel as
outpatient to be re-evaluated for statin therapy.  Pt was
successfully rate and pressure controlled with goal of: HR <70
and SBP <120.  The patient received a surgical evaluation for
possible CABG on [**2126-5-23**], he was already evaluated by anesthesia
while in house as well.  Pt is to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an
outpatient appointment as he still requires a carotid US prior
to undergoing CABG.
.
B).  Pump: Pt with STEMI, and unknown pre-MI cardiac function.
TTE demonstrates a reduced EF of 35%.  Given lack of clinical
findings of CHF, he was not actively diuresed.  He was however
counseled on fluid and salt balance and given some education on
dietary control.
.
C).  Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemtry during the
duration of his stay and he was in NSR to sinus bradycardia
during his admission.  His bradycardia limitted use of beta
blocker.  This should be re-addressed as an outpatient.
.
D).  Primary risk reduction:  The patient was initially started
on lipitor 80mg QHS given his ACS.  However due to slightly
elevated LFT, the statins were held.  We recommend outpatient
follow up of his LFT and cholesterol.  If LFTs are normal, the
patient will benefit from statins.  The patient was counsel on
lifestyle, diet, and exercise and their impact on his
cardiovascular as well as generalized health.  Even though his
FS and glucose on chemistries were wnl, his A1c was 6.4
suggesting some degree of glucose intolerance.  We recommend an
outpatient follow up of his glucose and A1c levels as
uncontrolled blood sugars have been shown to have an effect on
mortality.
.
.
2.  LBP: pt with hx of LBP.  He was given percocet PRN after
cath with good control.
.
.
3.  Elevated LFT: AST:ALT of 2.5 to 1 ratio suggestive of
possibly Alc liver disease.  Currently no sign of cirrhosis with
intact synthetic function.  Although he was initially started on
lipitor, this was stopped once his LFT were returned.  Suggest
outpatient LFT check and re-administration of lipitor if
possible.
.
.
4.  PPx: Pt was initially on integrillin after cath and then
subsequently on Heparin subQ TID for DVT prophylaxis.  Colace,
senna for bowel regimen, and PPI for ICU stress were also given
during his stay.
.

enzymes. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and started on a insulin regimen.
Pt. also presented in ARF which improved with IVF (2.6 to 1.2).
Pt. still had residual abd pain after therapy. A CT abdomen
showed possible small bowel ileitis and gallstones without
obstruction. GI was consulted who recommended continuing
treatment of DKA and small bowel follow through if pain
persists. Surgery was also consulted, suggested pt. follow up as
outpt. for cholecystectomy

CT ABD:IMPRESSION: 1) Diffuse low attenuation of the liver
consistent with fatty infiltration. No focal liver lesion is
identified.

2) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

3) Hypodensities within bilateral kidneys, the largest in the
right likely to represent a cyst, however, the remainder are too
small to characterize.

4) Mild bowel wall thickening of a short segment of distal ileum
which is nonspecific and may suggest ileitis. No evidence of
obstruction.

5) 3.0 x 2.2 cm left adnexal cyst for which ultrasound is
recommended for further evaluation in this post-menopausal
female.

ABD US:IMPRESSION:
1. Gallstones without additional signs of cholecystitis.
2. Fatty liver. Other forms of liver disease and more advanced
liver disease, including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded on this study.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 85-year-old female
presented to an outside hospital with substernal chest pain
radiating to her neck and back with shortness of breath and
nausea.  The episode lasted about an hour and resolved
spontaneously.  It recurred later that evening but did not
resolve.  She was brought to the Emergency Room and was
hemodynamically stable.  EKG changes were noted at that time.
Cardiology was called.  The patient still had significant
chest pain and had received sublingual nitroglycerin and was
on a nitroglycerin drip, beta blocker, aspirin, and heparin
drip and was transferred into [**Hospital1 **].

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Bumex 0.5 once a day.
2.  K-Dur 20 once a day.
3.  Avapro 300 once a day.
4.  Atenolol 50 once a day.
5.  Calcium.
6.  Multivitamin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  The patient has no
alcohol history.  The patient has no smoking history.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  History of right total knee replacement.
4.  History of polypectomy in [**2113-8-20**] without GI
bleed.

When she was brought into [**Hospital3 **], she was taken to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory which showed the
following:  Cardiac output 2.1, left main 30%, LAD 100%
occlusion, circumflex 90% occlusion, and RCA 90% occlusion
with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory and the patient remained on IV
heparin, IV Integrelin, IV nitroglycerin, and was receiving
aspirin and Plavix.  The diagnosis was a posterolateral
myocardial infarction based on EKG changes and laboratory
work.

She was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was seen first by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21815**], Cardiac Surgery, Chief Resident, who
noted her index at 1.5.  She was alert and oriented, a rather
small petite woman.  Her chest was clear.  Her heart sounds
were distant.  In addition, she had no carotid bruits.  She
had no murmur.  Her abdominal examination was benign.  Her
leg showed no varicosities with good distal pulses.

Her preoperative laboratory work showed a sodium of 130, K
8.6, chloride 98, C02 21, BUN 38, creatinine 1.6.  Her CK was
199.  Her white count was 11.2, platelet count 285,000, and
hematocrit of 41 with an INR of 1.1.  He noted her diagnosis
of acute myocardial infarction and recommended an
echocardiogram to evaluate her ventricular function.

The patient initially refused surgery on the night of the 7th
but agreed that it was her best option the following morning.
She was taken to the Operating Room after the echocardiogram
was performed at night which was a limited examination,
according to the cardiology note, but the LV ejection
fraction appeared well preserved without any focal wall
motion abnormalities.  There was also no significant MR, TR
and 1+ AI.  There was a small pericardial effusion versus a
fat pad.  Please refer to the cardiology note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 976**].

The patient was seen again on the morning of [**2113-11-26**]
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and on [**2113-11-26**] went to the Operating
Room.  She had a coronary artery bypass grafting times four
with a LIMA to the diagonal, vein graft to the LAD, vein
graft to the PDA, and a vein graft to the OM by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The intra-aortic balloon pump was still in place in the right
femoral artery.

The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition on
a dobutamine drip at 5 micrograms per kilogram per minute,
Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.3 micrograms per kilogram per
minute, and a propofol drip at 10 micrograms per kilogram per
minute.

The patient also got a transfusion for some blood loss
postoperatively.  On postoperative day number one, the
patient had been extubated the night prior, was
hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 100/40, CVP
14, and output of 3.3, index 2.1.  The balloon was on 1:2
weaning mode.  The white count was 14.2, hematocrit 26.5,
platelet count 93,000.  The first postoperative laboratories
also included a sodium of 132, K 5.1, chloride 108, C02 18,
BUN 23, creatinine 1.3, blood sugar 84.

The lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases. The heart
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The chest tubes had no
leak.  The abdomen was soft. The chest incision was clean,
dry, and intact.  The extremities were warm.  She was alert
without any neurological deficits.  She was receiving
morphine.  Her diet was advanced.  She continued on her
perioperative antibiotics.  She remained on dobutamine,
insulin, and Neo-Synephrine drip, and started her Protonix GI
protection as well as the Reglan.

It was noted later that day that the echocardiogram had shown
decreased LV function to approximately 35-40% and the
decision was made that evening to electively intubate the
patient and take the patient back to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory to examine the grafts to determine
if there was any blockage.

The patient was taken back to the Catheterization Laboratory
on the night of [**2113-11-27**].  A milrinone drip had been
started.  The patient was on an Amiodarone drip for atrial
fibrillation.  The cardiac catheterization showed that the
grafts were open.  The patient was in sinus rhythm at 75 with
a blood pressure of 91/31 on postoperative day number two.
The patient remained intubated, continued on perioperative
antibiotics and receiving Plavix as well as IV Amiodarone.

The hematocrit rose to 28.3.  The white count rose to 19.5.
All other laboratories were within the normal range or coming
down slowly.  The lactic acid was 2.1 and then went to 138
which seemed to be a laboratory error.  The MBs were
negative.  The troponin was greater than 50.

The lungs had coarse breath sounds at the bases.  The
extremities were warm with bilateral Dopplerable signals on
her feet.  Her index was 2.6 on milrinone, Neo-Synephrine,
the balloon.  The balloon continued to remain in wean mode.
The patient continued to receive H2 blockers as well as the
aspirin and Plavix.

The patient was seen by Respiratory Therapy on postoperative
day number three.  The patient was started empirically on
Levofloxacin for the rising white count and continued on
perioperative vancomycin and the patient remained on
Amiodarone, insulin, milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, and
.................... in addition to the prior oral drugs
mentioned.

The patient remained intubated and woke up.  The plan was to
wean the ventilator to extubation, Swan Foley and pacing
wires.  The balloon remained in place.  The patient had good
urine output and the hematocrit was stable.

The patient was seen by the case manager and Nutrition on
postoperative day number four.  The balloon had been
discontinued.  The patient failed the extubation attempt
overnight due to tachypnea.  The patient remained on double
antibiotic coverage and was on SIMV with pressure support and
breathing above the ventilator with a PEEP of 5.  The white
count started to drop down.  The sputum culture showed 1+
gram-negative rods.  The culture was still pending.
Creatinine dropped from 1.8 to 1.7.  The hematocrit dropped
from 33 to 30.  The white count went from 15 to 11.5.  The
patient remained intubated and somewhat restless.  The wounds
were clean, dry, and intact.  The patient had 2+ nonpitting
edema.

The patient remained on .................... as well as
Amiodarone, milrinone, Neo-Synephrine, and insulin drip.  The
plan was to continue try to extubate the patient.  The
patient was followed by the CCU fellow.  Milrinone was weaned
off later during the day.  Anesthesia saw the patient again
on the 12th after extubation had been completed but was
called again at 11:00 p.m. on the night of the 12th to
reintubate the patient for respiratory distress.

It also should be noted that on postoperative day number two
there was a right pleural effusion noted on chest x-ray.  A
right chest tube was placed on the 18th and removed two days
later.  This showed good drainage and good placement on
postoperative films.  The patient obviously was seen every
day by Respiratory Therapy.

On postoperative day number five, the patient remained again
on double antibiotic coverage on an Amiodarone, milrinone,
and nitroglycerin drip as well as receiving midazolam.  The
patient continued also on antiplatelet therapy.  The lungs
were clear bilaterally.  The heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  The patient had a blood pressure that was stable
with an index of 2.3, CVP 18.  The patient did remain
somewhat restless.  The vancomycin completed a four day
course.  Levofloxacin continued.  The cultures continued to
be negative.  The patient was maintaining good output.

On postoperative day number six, the patient remained on
levofloxacin.  Neo-Synephrine was off.  The patient remained
on an Amiodarone drip at 0.3.  The patient was breathing
approximately 19 rate above the ventilator.  The patient had
a good index of 2.1, remained intubated and restless, again
with now coarse breath sounds, slightly decreased bilateral
lower extremity edema, but wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  The patient had increased secretions.

The plan was again to try and wake up the patient and attempt
extubation.  Foley, Swan, and pacing wires remained in place.
The patient remained in the ICU.

On postoperative day number seven, the patient was A-paced at
a rate of 88, remained on Amiodarone and ....................
with an index of 2.1.  She remained sedated.  She was
somewhat tachypneic.  The patient had a small serous drainage
on her leg saphenectomy site.  She was somewhat comfortable.
The plan was to continue to try to extubate her and repeat
her hematocrit and remain on Amiodarone.

After extubation was attempted, the patient was reintubated
at 8:00 p.m. on the night of the 15th.  She remained a little
bit restless on postoperative day number eight on a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.3 and back on a propofol drip at 30.
The plan was to try to wean the Neo-Synephrine and continue
her diaphoresis and to consider tube feeds.  The patient
remained in the ICU.  The blood pressure was 135/65, in sinus
rhythm in the 90s.

On postoperative day number nine, the patient continued on
antibiotic coverage with Levofloxacin, was on a
Neo-Synephrine drip and a propofol drip with no events
overnight.  The blood pressure was 95/40.  The patient was in
sinus rhythm in the 60s with an output of 3 and an index of
2.  The patient was also started on Captopril and continued
now on Amiodarone.

The plan was to continue the afterload reduction which was
being accomplished with the Captopril and trying to wean the
Neo-Synephrine.  The patient's creatinine was 1.6 and the
hematocrit was stable at 31.7.  The lungs continued to have
coarse breath sounds with 2+ edema bilaterally on her lower
extremities.  The chest incision was clean, dry, and intact.
The patient remained sedated with propofol.

On postoperative day number ten, the patient was on the ninth
day of levofloxacin coverage and was placed on a dopamine
drip of 3 and was on propofol.  Neo-Synephrine was off.  The
patient also continued on Amiodarone.  The patient remained
intubated and sedated.  The lungs were clear bilaterally.  A
repeat echocardiogram showed severe MR.  The patient had a
good blood gas on SIMV.

On postoperative day number 11, the patient was on the tenth
day of levofloxacin course on a dopamine drip of 3 and a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.3.  The patient was breathing at
approximately 11 above the ventilator.  The creatinine
dropped to 1.4.  The heart was regular in rate and rhythm
with some premature ventricular contractions, coarse breath
sounds bilaterally.  The wounds were clean, dry, and intact.
Most of the lower extremity edema was on the right leg with
none noted on the left.  Urine showed Klebsiella which was
sensitive to levofloxacin.  Blood cultures were negative.
Sputum showed oral flora.  The patient remained 6.7 kilograms
up in fluid.  She continued to be diuresed.

The patient started tube feeds and remained in the ICU.  She
continued to be followed by Case Management.  On
postoperative day number 12, the patient continued to breathe
above the ventilator.  She was following commands.  She
remained intubated.  The lungs were clear.  The heart was
regular in rate and rhythm.  The extremity edema was
decreasing.  The plan was to continue diuresis.  The patient
had a good urine output, was a liter negative.  The plan was
to discontinue the chest tube which was pulled on the 20th.

On postoperative day number 13, the patient remained in sinus
rhythm on a dopamine drop at 3 with a hematocrit of 35, white
count 11.7, creatinine that dropped from 1.4 to 1.2.  She was
intubated and following commands.  There were no changes.
The plan was to allow the patient to fully wake up and
attempt to extubate her.  Now, the levofloxacin course was
continued for her urinary tract infection.  Her central line
wire was sent for culture which was pending.  Her sputum
showed gram-positive bacteria with some sparse growth.

The patient had been extubated earlier in the day but was
reintubated by Anesthesia at 8:00 p.m. that night.  On
postoperative day number 14, the patient remained on a
dopamine drip and a propofol drip and continued on
levofloxacin.  The patient had a cardiac index of 2.8 with a
CVP of 9.  The patient was in sinus tachycardia in the 100s
with a blood pressure of 107/48.  The patient remained
intubated and sedated.

It was planned to have the patient have a tracheostomy.  The
patient continued on tube feeds.  The Swan was discontinued
with a new central line placed.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed with
the family the need for tracheostomy.  On postoperative day
number 15, the patient remained on dopamine and propofol.  No
changes in heart or lung status.  The wounds were clean, dry,
and intact with no additional edema.  The white count was
9.9, hematocrit 31.5, creatinine 1.4.  The patient continued
on levofloxacin for a UTI.

On postoperative day number 16, the patient remained on a
dopamine drop of 1.5, Neo-Synephrine at 0.25 and a propofol
drip of 15.  She was in sinus rhythm in the 90s with a blood
pressure of 88/34, CVP 12.  She remained intubated and
sedated.  Catheter tip showed staphylococcus.  The patient
was placed back on vancomycin for 48 hours for the
staphylococcus as wires and lines were in place.  Creatinine
remained stable at 1.4.  The white count dropped to 8.2.

On postoperative day number 17, the patient remained on the
same drips.  She remained intubated and sedated.  She was
continued on Amiodarone, aspirin, and Captopril.  She had a
little bit of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis.
This was managed.  The patient was also managed by the ICU
team.  The patient also received Miconazole and hydralazine.
The urine culture came back negative.  Sputum culture came
back negative.

The patient was also seen by Thoracic who assessed the
patient for tracheostomy and PEG.  The patient again was seen
by Case Management.

On the 26th, the patient did receive a tracheostomy.  She
remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip as well as hydralazine.
The hematocrit was steady at 31.  The patient had no other ID
issues.  The patient also receive percutaneous gastrectomy.
The percutaneous tracheostomy was aborted secondary to
aspiration, a large amount of bright red blood.  The
procedure was aborted.  The patient was taken to the
Operating Room for open tracheostomy which was performed on
the 26th.  The patient also received a bronchoscopy to
evaluate the airway.  Please refer to the report.

On postoperative day number 19, the patient remained stable
on the current ventilator settings and had been
tracheostomied.  The white count was 13, hematocrit 28.4.
The patient was sinus tachycardia in the 90s with a blood
pressure of 124/52 with a temperature maximum of 100.6.

Plans were now discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about trying to wean
the patient on postoperative day number 20.  The patient
remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip.  The patient was breathing
comfortably on the ventilator with a tracheostomy collar.
Tube feeds were the goal.  Adequate urine output.  No ID
issues.  The patient remained in the CSRU.

Postoperative film after the PEG showed a small amount of
free air, but this resolved within two days after the
procedure.  The gastrografin study was reportedly negative by
Dr. .................... on the 29th.  The patient had some
vomiting in the evening prior to postoperative day number 21.
The patient was on no drip.  Amiodarone dosing was down from
400 b.i.d. to 400 q.d.  The patient was comfortable on the
tracheostomy mask.  The hematocrit was stable at 31.

Tube feeds were held and restarted then later to check the
residuals.  On postoperative day number two, the patient
remained on a Neo-Synephrine drip.  Laboratory values were
stable.  The creatinine had come down to 1.1.  The patient
continued the tracheostomy mask and tolerated it well over
the course of the day.  The tube feeds were accomplished via
the PEG.  No ID issues.

On postoperative day number 23, the patient remained on a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.18 with a blood pressure of 98/48
and a sinus rhythm in the 90s.  The sternal wound was clean,
dry, and intact.  There was no click.  The patient remained
on Amiodarone.  On a GI protective drug.

On postoperative day number 24, the patient continued on
Neo-Synephrine, was being covered by sliding scale insulin as
per ICU protocol.  Respiratory films were slightly course.
The wounds were clean, dry, and intact.

A Passy-Muir valve evaluation was completed by the
Rehabilitation Services and the nursing staff was instructed
in its use.  On postoperative day number 25, the patient was
on tracheostomy mask all day and rested on the ventilator
overnight.  Her Foley was removed. She had been off
Neo-Synephrine for 24 hours.  She continued Lasix diuresis as
well as her GI protective drugs.  She was also receiving
Albuterol.  The patient was awake, alert, intermittently
following commands.  The incisions had no erythema or
drainage.  The heart sounds were a regular rate and rhythm.
She had coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  The hematocrit was
28.9 with a white count of 7, creatinine 1.1, K 4.1.  Pain
control issues were addressed.  The patient remained on
Plavix and aspirin and was screened for rehabilitation.

She was seen repeated by the GI staff.  The patient had some
melena overnight on the 4th.  She had been having some melena
intermittently for a week.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
GI who planned to take her for an EGD.  Her ""encephalopathy""
secondary to hospitalization in the ICU was also noted
basically through her prolonged ICU stay.  She had no prior
history of GI problems.  His assessment was that she probably
had an upper GI bleed from a duodenal ulcer with reflux into
the stomach or stress gastritis and planned to do the EGD.
The EGD showed grade I esophagitis and erosion in the GE
junction and diagnosis of gastritis with no bleeding site
found.  Plavix was stopped.  Aspirin was stopped temporarily.
This was later restarted for her cardiac coronary bypass
coverage.  She was transfused 2 units of packed blood cells
on the 27th, postoperative day number 27, with a hematocrit
of 29.3.  Her blood pressure remained slightly lower at 92/37
to 103/40 range.  She was saturating 98%.

The plan was to do colonoscopy on postoperative day number
27.  She had a prior colonoscopy which did not show anything.
She was seen by Rehabilitation Services, Case Management, and
seen again by Physical Therapy.  On postoperative day number
28, her hematocrit was 30.  She was doing bowel prep in
preparation for colonoscopy which was scheduled for that day.
Aspirin was restarted.  Plavix was discontinued.

She continued on postoperative day number 29 with Lasix
diuresis. She had six beats of VT.  She was awake but
somewhat tachypneic.  Her hematocrit rose to 32.1 with a
creatinine of 1.4, white count 9.6.  Her chest x-ray showed
moderate CHF.  Her electrolytes were repleted.  She continued
on Lopressor and Captopril as well as her Amiodarone.  She
was placed back on the ventilator and continued with Lasix
and aspirin.

She was somewhat agitated periodically.  She was rested on
the ventilator secondary to tachypnea.  She followed commands
but not consistently.  The following day she appeared more
comfortable.  She had bilateral effusions on chest x-ray.
Her Lasix was held for a blood pressure that ranged all the
way down to 78/26.  Tube feeds continued on postoperative day
number 31.  She remained on an insulin drip.  Her tube feeds
continued at 55.  Her right effusion was drained.  She
remained on sliding scale insulin, Colace, Combivent,
Amiodarone, Lopressor, Haldol, aspirin, Lasix, and Prevacid.
She had coarse breath sounds but her heart was regular in
rate and rhythm in the 90s and sinus rhythm with a pressure
of 119/53.

She continued on the sliding scale insulin and received some
free water.  She remained in the ICU with the tracheostomy
and Foley and the gastric tube.  She was reevaluated by
[**Hospital1 **].  She was seen by Physical Therapy.  On today, the
day of discharge, postoperative day number 32, she was
transferred to the CCU in preparation for her transfer out to
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

Her vital signs revealed a temperature maximum of 100.6,
heart rate 94, blood pressure 118/58, respiratory rate 20,
saturating 100%.  She remained on a tracheostomy mask with a
Bakes line breathing rate of 20-40.  She remained on tube
feeds.  She is on pressure support.

Her laboratories on the date of discharge are as follows:
White count 8, hematocrit 30.5, platelet count 205,000.
Sodium 149, K 4.3, chloride 112, C02 28, BUN 41, creatinine
1.2, blood sugar 126.  Her calcium, magnesium were in normal
range.  Albumin 2.6.

Her respiratory sounds were coarse.  Her abdomen was soft.
Her extremities were warm and are healing.  She continued on
her Lopressor.  She continues with her tracheostomy, G tube,
and Foley.  She also is on the following medications at the
time of discharge today:  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Combivent, Amiodarone 200 once a day, Lopressor 12.5 twice a
day, Haldol 2 mg p.o. three times a day, aspirin 81 mg once a
day, Prevacid 30 mg once a day, NPH 10 units at dinner, and a
sliding scale of insulin.  She also remains on her eyedrops.
Her eyedrops are Latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution one
drop O.U. q.h.s.  Her cardiac status is stable.  She is ready
for transfer to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times four.
2.  Status post open tracheostomy and percutaneous gastric
tube placement.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Status post right total hip replacement.
7.  Status post upper gastrointestinal bleed with resolution
confirmed by upper endoscopy.  It appears that colonoscopy
was not done given the patient's prior history of negative
colonoscopy.

Again, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
in stable condition on [**2113-11-28**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year-old
female with a history of positive kidney disease and
polycystic liver disease who presented on [**7-28**] preoperative
for a combined orthotopic liver and cadaveric renal
transplant.  The patient had a recent cardiac workup, which
was negative and endoscopy for gastrojejunal polyps, which
was also negative for malignancy.  The patient denied fevers
or chills, coughs, nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness
of breath, bowel and bladder dysfunction.  The patient had a
history of multiple abdominal surgeries and massive ventral
hernias with very little abdominal wall left.  The patient
was last seen in the [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic in [**2171-4-6**].  The
patient also had family members that suffered from polycystic
kidney disease with family members with cadaveric kidney
transplants.  She also had family members that suffered from
polycystic liver disease as well consistent with abdominal
dominant inheritance.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Polycystic liver and kidney disease.
Multiple ventral hernia repairs in [**2161**].  Anemia.
Hypertension.  Total abdominal hysterectomy.  Bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2153**].
Status post appendectomy in [**2155**].  Status post exploratory
laparotomy LOA in [**2163**].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aldactone.
2.  Lasix.
3.  Norvasc.
4.  Mycelex.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not drink or smoke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, blood pressure
114/62, 81, 20, 98% on room air.  The patient weighed 105
kilograms.  The patient was awake and alert on physical
examination and abdominal examination showed obese massive
ventral hernias with an ulcer on the left side, surgical
scars well healed, soft and nontender.  The rest of the
patient's physical examination on admission was unremarkable.

LABORATORY:  The patient has a TSH on admission of 3.5,
hepatitis B and A negative.  HIV negative.  Echocardiogram
showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction, normal PAP.
Stress test was normal.  Gastrojejunal biopsy was negative
for malignancy.  Chest x-ray was clear.  White blood cell
count 7.8, hematocrit 33, platelets 233, fibrinogen of 438,
urinalysis negative.  Chemistry showed a sodium of 137,
potassium 4.5, chloride 103, bicarb 20, BUN 74, creatinine
2.4, glucose 120.  Serologies included EBV, IGG positive by
EIA.  RPR was nonreactive.  CMV positive, VZV positive,
rubella IGG positive [**2171-6-19**], toxo IGG negative.

PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Orthotopic liver transplantation and cadaveric renal
transplantation combined procedure [**7-29**].
2.  Perforated small bowel oversewn [**8-4**].
3.  Hemoperitoneum with exploratory laparotomy [**8-15**].
4.  Perforated colonic anastomosis status post transverse
colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch and end colostomy on [**8-24**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cadaveric kidney transplantation,
orthotopic liver transplantation combined procedure was
performed on [**2171-7-29**].  The patient had a kidney transplant
that was intraperitoneal with ureterurostomy with stent and a
right native nephrectomy.  The patient had an orthotopic
liver transplantation at the same time with prolonged
hospital course as well as Intensive Care Unit stay.  Initial
operations complicated by dense adhesions for multiple
previous operations, which took approximately three hours to
enter the abdomen.  During the course of the adhesiolysis a
colotomy was made in the transverse colon requiring sleeve
resection.  The patient also had serosal tear of small bowel,
which was repaired.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for postoperative care.  On [**8-4**] the
patient developed pneumoperitoneum and was taken back to the
Operating Room where a small bowel perforation was found and
repaired.  Even preoperatively the patient had large amount
of ascitic fluid requiring 8 liters of paracentesis
preoperatively.  Postoperatively, the patient had very large
acidic output over 3 liters a day.  Postoperatively, the
patient care was complicated by bouts of atrial fibrillation
and echocardiogram by cardiology by cardiology revealed
pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology without
systemic hemodynamic systems.  Repeat echocardiogram revealed
increased tamponade with worsening tamponade physiology.  For
this, on the evening the [**7-15**] pericardiocentesis was
performed.  The patient was returned to the Intensive Care
Unit when hematocrit began to fall and rapid atrial
fibrillation ensued.  The patient was taken emergently to the
Operating Room where she was found to have a pericardial
drain in the pericardium and a large hemoperitoneum.  The
patient's abdomen was washed out for hemoperitoneum and the
pericardial window was performed with follow up
echocardiogram that showed complete resolution of the
pericardial effusion.

On the 19th the patient again developed worsening
pneumoperitoneum and was taken back to the Operating Room for
exploratory laparotomy.  The patient was found to have
completely walled off abscess at the site of the previous
colonic resection.  The patient had a transverse colectomy,
Hartmann's pouch and ascending colostomy.  The patient was
washed out and drains were placed.  The remainder of the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was noted as being normal with
normal hepatic function, creatinine that remained at 2.5 and
3 liters of acidic output a day.  Acidic creatinine was 2.7.
Because of high index suspicion nuclear renal scan was
obtained and demonstrated urinary leak.  Cystoscopy was
performed demonstrating migration of the stent into the
ureter and two areas of leak.  A bridging stent was placed
across.  The remainder of the hospital course showed noted
improvement.  The patient was advanced to and tolerated a
regular diet with normal colostomy function.  Creatinine
decreased to 1.0 and JP output decreased to 30 cc and was
removed.  The patient is currently working with physical
therapy and is out of bed to chair.

The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation on [**2171-9-13**] to have immunosuppressive medications adjusted
according to blood levels by transplant team only and blood
work every Monday and Thursday in the a.m. prior to Neoral
and Prograf ingestion.  CBC with differential, chem 7,

Date of Birth:   [**2090-11-8**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Psychiatry

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old woman with
a history of depression and anxiety who was discharged from
the medical service three weeks ago after an admission for
shortness of breath culminating in her being sent home with
home oxygen (a new requirement).  Subsequently she had had a
nodule found on
pulmonary computerized tomography scan which was believed to
be benign, and she has been increasingly ruminative regarding
perceived financial difficulties as well as increased medical
problems.  The patient reports that her sleep has become
erratic with middle insomnia, decreased appetite, poor
concentration and depressed mood.  She has felt increasingly
withdrawn, not answering the telephone, and not checking for
e-mails.  She has imagined death as ""relief,"" and has had
egodystonic fantasies without intent of attempting suicide
with a knife.  She feels that her difficulties have developed
in concert with worsening medical health.  In addition she
has been taking very poor care of herself, struggling even to
get dressed in the morning.  On the day of admission the
patient had been stating to her daughter, ""everything is
wrong.""  She has been perseverative regarding
unwarranted (according to multiple collaterals) financial
concerns (similar to the way she was
after her husband's death and after this event she had
attempted suicide).  The patient had repeated to her daughter
""I'm going to die, my head is going to make me die.""  The
patient would not hang up the phone with her daughter out of
fear that she would die.

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Two prior psychiatric admissions,
one at the age of 18 at the Institute of Living for
Depression and Anxiety, the second one 11 years ago at [**Hospital6 1760**] after a suicide attempt via
overdose after the death of her husband.  The patient has
been seeing Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] the past 11 years and sees him now
about once a year.  She has never been tried on an SSRI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Congestive heart failure,
secondary to viral cardiomyopathy; 2.  Hypertension; 3.  3+
Mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension; 4.  Asthma;
5.  Kyphoscoliosis and severe restrictive lung disease; 6.
Unilateral vocal cord paralysis; 7.  Right middle lobe lung
nodule noted on computerized tomography scan of the chest in
[**2161-12-1**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Digoxin .25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Folate 1 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Zestril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Albuterol 1 to 2 puffs q. 12 hours
8.  Fluticasone 2 puffs b.i.d.
9.  Multivitamin p.o. q.d.
10. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Desipramine 50 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
13. Fosamax 70 mg p.o. q. week
14. Home oxygen at 2 liters per minute

In addition the patient takes antibiotics prior to any dental
work.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:  The patient denies any history of
alcohol or drug abuse.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been widowed for 11 years.
She is a mother of two with a daughter and a son and has
three grandchildren.  She worked at [**Location 24537**] a
womens program for 29 years up until about ten years ago.
She currently lives in [**Location 745**] with her boyfriend of 7 1/2
years.  She reports that her husband who died 11 years ago
was an alcoholic.  She denies any current or past history of
domestic violence.

FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Depression and suicide attempt
in a brother.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed her to be afebrile with vital signs stable.
Physical examination was notable for marked kyphoscoliosis,
III/VI systolic murmur on cardiac examination and extremities
were notable for 1+ edema bilaterally to mid calf.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission complete blood count was
notable for white count of 13.8 which decreased to 10 on
repeat.  Chem-10 was notable for an elevated bicarbonate at
40, liver function tests were normal, RPR nonreactive, TSH
was 2.0.  Serum and urine toxicology screens were negative
including serum tricyclic level was negative and arterial
blood gases performed on [**6-26**] was 7.43/56/107/45.  An
electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus rhythm,
premature atrial contractions, interventricular conduction
delays, possible left ventricular hypertrophy, anterolateral
ST abnormality with no change from the previous
electrocardiogram of [**5-30**].  Chest x-ray showed severe
scoliosis with clear lungs and no effusions.  Chest
computerized tomography scan performed just prior to
admission showed a stable right middle lobe nodule sized at 3
mm and a new left upper lobe nodule sized at 5 mm.

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:  The patient was neatly dressed
wearing oxygen via nasal cannula and pushing an oxygen tank.
She appeared slightly older than her stated age.  She made
good eye contact.  [**Name (NI) **] speech was hoarse, slightly slowed
with increased latent periods.  Her mood was ""overwhelmed.""
Her affect was dysphoric.  Her thought process was slow but
linear.  Her thought content was focused on financial
worries.  She admitted to thoughts of death as ""relief"" and
occasional egodystonic fantasies of suicide via knife but
when she reached the inpatient unit she adamantly denied
suicidal intent.  She had no psychotic symptoms but severe
rumination regarding medical condition and preoccupations of
guilt, stating her belief that she had become a burden for
her family.  Her cognitive examination was grossly intact.
Her insight and judgment were good.  She had great difficulty
maintaining hope.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Medical course - The patient's primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], followed her closely
(with daily visits) throughout her
hospital stay.  She was
continued on her pre-admission outpatient medications.  The blood
gases noted above showed a mildly increased carbon dioxide
compared to her baseline of 66 up from 60.  The patient,
however, was continued on oxygen at 2 liters/minute as this
was considered to be an insignificant change.  Given the
history of lung nodules, a head computerized tomography scan
was obtained to rule out brain metastases from a possible
cancer and the head computerized tomography scan was negative
for metastases.  The patient had recently had a sleep study
as an outpatient that indicated that CPAP could be helpful.
A pulmonary consultation was obtained and BiPAP was
recommended.  She was started on BiPAP and tolerated a
setting of [**9-4**] (she will follow up in the sleep clinic with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for this).  A second arterial blood gases on room
air showed significant hypoxia with a pO2 of 45 and a pCO2 of
60, so continue with oxygen, not just on exertion was
recommended.  The patient also complained of sporadic
monocular diplopia with [**Location (un) 1131**] which she thought had started
prior to admission.  An ophthalmology consultation was
obtained and they report that the symptoms can be consistent
with dry eyes caused by the increased flow of air from the
oxygen.  Preservative free eye drops were started with good
effect.  The patient was also seen by her cardiologist for
increased pedal edema.  He recommended adding an additional
40 mg of Furosemide in the afternoon every other day with
supplemental potassium every other day.  He said her goal
weight should be roughly 137 lb.  He recommended daily
weights and monitoring of the BUN and creatinine every week.
Her weight fell to 136 after starting the additional
Furosemide and BUN and creatinine remained within normal
limits.  Elastic stockings were also begun per the patient's
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], the patient's edema
continued up to the point of this dictation.

[**Hospital 7637**] hospital course - The patient was admitted
voluntarily to the Inpatient Psychiatric Service.  The
Desipramine was tapered off given that it was ineffective at
the current dose and the cardiotoxic interactions are more
likely at higher doses.  Citalopram was started at 10 mg p.o.
q.d. and slowly increased up to 40 mg p.o. q.d.  (Citalopram
was found to have no significant interactions with the
patient's current medications on a Micromedex search.)  She
was continued on her longterm medication of Clonazepam at a
low dose of 0.5 mg t.i.d.  Neuropsychiatric testing was
performed.  The patient was noted to have reduced verbal
learning and reduced rapid retrieval of information.  She was
also noted to have decreased visual scanning.  These problems
were thought to be consistent with vascular changes from
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease though an ongoing
dementing process could not be ruled out.  An occupational
therapy safety assessment was performed and found that the
patient had the safety skills to return to her own home.  An
occupational therapy home assessment was recommended along
with [**Hospital6 407**] services when she does return
home.  Occupational therapy worked extensively with the
patient regarding how to deal with her oxygen tank.  In
general, the patient was very focused on her oxygen tank and
her perceived inability to learn how to handle it (and
particularly that the tank would run out of oxygen). Her
ruminations also included worries about running out of money,
running out of insurance and concerns that her daughter would
have to give up graduate school because of her illness.  She
was frustrated by the resistance of her illness to treatment
and as her depression proved difficult to treat
electroconvulsive therapy was considered, however, the
[**Hospital 228**] medical problems (d/w'ed PCP and patient's
cardiologist) would put her at much higher risk
than the average patient so it was decided to continue with
medication treatment.  Given the ruminative parapsychotic
nature of the depression, antipsychotic therapy with
quetiapine was started on [**7-8**].  She noted severe
morning sedation on the quetiapine at a dose of 50 mg
q.h.s., so she was switched to Risperidone which was much
less sedating.  As the patient continued to express inability
to concentrate and very low energy, it was decided to start a
trial of Ritalin after telephone consultation with the
covering cardiologist.  The patient has not yet received her
first dose of Ritalin at the time of this dictation.
Multiple family meetings were held with the patient's son and
daughter.  The patient's long time boyfriend did not
participate in formal family meetings, though he was
encouraged to do and did communicate with team members
individually.

The rest of the hospital course, discharge diagnosis,
discharge medications and follow up plans will be dictated in
an addendum to this discharge summary when the patient is
discharged from the hospital.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female with a history of congestive heart failure,
hypertension, restrictive lung disease, kyphoscoliosis, and
major depression who was admitted to the Inpatient Psychiatry
Service on [**2163-6-25**] for depression and ruminations about
her physical condition; mostly because of her recently
discovered lung nodule that was believed to be benign.

The patient recently had her antidepressant (desipramine)
discontinued and was being considered for electroconvulsive
therapy, but ultimately was started on a course of Celexa and
Risperdal with methylphenidate be added on [**7-18**].

On the morning of admission to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit ([**7-18**]), the patient became acutely short of breath
with her oxygen saturation decreasing down to 55%.  An
arterial blood gas was done that showed a pH of 7.17, a PCO2
of 106, and a PO2 of 108 while on nasal cannula oxygen.

Therefore, the patient was semi-electively intubated and
brought to the Intensive Care Unit for a suspected
hypercarbic respiratory failure.

She has been taking all of her regular medications.  She
reports no fevers, chills, or chest pain.  An
electrocardiogram at the time of this incident showed ST
depressions in the inferolateral leads along with
tachycardia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure (with a recent echocardiogram in
[**2163-1-29**] which showed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of greater than 60%, 3+ mitral regurgitation, and
pulmonary hypertension).
2.  Asthma; pulmonary function tests in [**2163-5-31**] revealed
an FEV1 of 35%, FVC of 34%, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 101%;
consistent with a restrictive lung pattern.
3.  Kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung disease.
4.  Chronic CO2 retention.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Right middle lobe lung nodule 5 mm in diameter that has
had no change on serial chest computed tomography scan.  A
brain computed tomography was also negative for metastasis.
The patient has a recently discovered left lung nodule.
7.  Depression.

ALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN and ERYTHROMYCIN (uncertain
reaction).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once per day
 2.  Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.

[**7-18**]).
13.  Risperdal 1 mg by mouth q.h.s.
14.  Citalopram 40 mg by mouth once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been widowed for 11 years.
She is the mother of two (with a daughter and a son) and has
three grandchildren.  She worked at [**Location 24537**] a
woman's program for 29 years until about 10 years ago.  She
currently lives in [**Location 745**] with her boyfriend of seven and a
half years.  She reports that her husband, who died 11 years
ago, was an alcoholic.  She denies any history of alcohol or
drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 99.1
degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 72, her blood pressure
was 134/60, her respiratory rate was 14, and her pulse
oximetry was 98% (assist control tidal volume 400,
respiratory rate 13, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5,
30% FIO2).  In general, an elderly female who was sedated and
intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
muscles were intact.  The mucous membranes were moist.  Neck
examination revealed no jugular venous distention.  No bruits
of carotids.  The neck was supple.  Lung examination revealed
diffuse rales, soft wheezes, and good air movement
throughout.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a 4/6
systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the precordium.  A
regular rate and rhythm with frequent premature ventricular
contractions noted on the monitor.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ edema at the ankles
bilaterally.  The feet were cool bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratory
data on admission revealed electrolytes with a sodium of 141,
potassium was 4.1, chloride was 97, bicarbonate was 39, and
her blood glucose was 297.  Free calcium was 1.31.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 2.  Rapid plasma reagin was
negative.  Blood urea nitrogen was 22.  Creatinine was 0.5.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute, normal axis, and
normal intervals.  Question of a left atrial abnormality.
Downsloping ST depressions of 1 mm to 2 mm in size in leads
I, II, aVF, and V3 through V6.

A chest x-ray revealed severe kyphoscoliosis.  No acute
infiltrate.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient presented to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit after an episode of hypercarbic
respiratory failure.

A chest x-ray showed minimal evidence of congestive heart
failure.  Therefore, a pulmonary embolism was suspected.
However, a chest computerized axial tomography with
angiography ruled out this diagnosis.

The patient's presentation was also suspicious a myocardial
infarction.  Cardiac enzymes were checked every eight hours
times three following the respiratory decompensation.
Creatine phosphokinase levels were found not to be elevated.
At troponin level did reach 0.1 on the second set.

A Cardiology consultation was obtained, and an echocardiogram
was done.  The patient was found to have no focal wall motion
abnormalities, left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%,
and severe 4+ mitral regurgitation.  Per the Cardiology
consultation, there was no evidence to support a myocardial
infarction and that the majority of the electrocardiogram
changes were felt to be consistent with prior examinations.

The patient's blood pressure was controlled initially with a
nitroglycerin drip during extubation on [**7-20**].
Overnight, the patient was weaned off the nitroglycerin drip
and started on a course of isosorbide dinitrate and
hydralazine as needed for blood pressure control.  Cardiology
advised bringing her systolic blood pressures close to 100.
As the patient is a chronic CO2 retainer, her oxygen
saturations were kept in the low 90s for the remainder of her
hospital stay.

Of note, on her computerized axial tomography two stable
pulmonary nodules with some surrounding lymphadenopathy were
noted.

2.  INTRAVENOUS ACCESS ISSUES:  An arterial line and left
subclavian central line were placed on [**7-18**] and were
discontinued on [**7-21**] in preparation for the patient's
discharge back to [**Hospital1 **] Four.  These lines were placed
without complications.

3.  DEPRESSION ISSUES:  The patient was very anxious
throughout her hospital stay.  All psychiatric medications;
including citalopram, Ativan, and Risperdal were continued as
previously prescribed to control her anxiety and fluctuating
mood.

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  To address the patient's history
of congestive heart failure, she was continued on Lipitor, a
beta blocker, aspirin, Lasix, and digoxin as previously
prescribed.  It was thought that her respiratory failure may
have been caused by a flash pulmonary edema related to her
congestive heart failure and mitral regurgitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.
The patient had no oxygen requirement at the time of
discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Ativan 0.25 mg by mouth three times per day.
 2.  Risperidone 1 mg by mouth q.h.s. and 0.25 mg by mouth
twice per day as needed.
 3.  Celexa 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 5.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.
 7.  Digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once per day.
 8.  Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.
 9.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
10.  Thiamine 100 mg by mouth once per day.
11.  Folate 1 mg by mouth once per day.
12.  Zestril 20 mg by mouth once per day.
13.  Albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs inhaled q.12h.
14.  Flovent 2 puffs inhaled q.12h.
15.  Fosamax 70 mg by mouth every week.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Restrictive lung disease.
5.  Kyphoscoliosis.
6.  Major depression.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] Four, the Inpatient Psychiatry Unit, for ongoing
management of her depression and anxiety.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] (her primary care
physician) while on [**Hospital1 **] Four.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] has been
informed of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.

Service:  Cardiothoracic

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from an outside hospital for
workup and treatment of endocarditis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 87 year old man with a
history of cardiomyopathy and hypertension along with sick
sinus syndrome status post pacemaker placement who was
transferred from [**Hospital6 38016**] for management
of questionable endocarditis.  The patient presented to the
[**Hospital 28159**] Hospital on [**3-21**] with complaints of 1?????? weeks
of persistent intermittent fevers, arthralgias, chills,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient was
admitted to the hospital where blood culture two out of two
came back with Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus
as did a urine culture.  The patient subsequently had a
culture on [**3-22**] which at the time of admission was growing
gram positive cocci in clusters consistent with
Staphylococcus.  The patient was initially treated with
Vancomycin but was switched to Oxacillin once the
sensitivities were returned.  He had a transesophageal
echocardiogram which revealed tricuspid vegetation and was
diagnosed with endocarditis and transferred for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Cardiomyopathy; 2.  Sick sinus
syndrome, status post permanent pacer; 3.  Hypertension; 4.
Diverticulosis; 5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post
transurethral resection of prostate; 6. Mild peripheral
neuropathy; 7.  Status post appendectomy; 8.  Small abdominal
aortic aneurysm; 9.  Anxiety disorder.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer from [**Hospital 28159**] Hospital
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
2.  Flonase
3.  Prevacid 30 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 38017**]
[**State 350**].  Son is an Infectious Disease specialist.
remote tobacco use and rare alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of
admission revealed vital signs with heartrate of 76, blood
pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturations
95% on 2 liters.  Temperature was 101.3.  General, alert, ill
appearing gentleman.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
pupils were equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
motions intact.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Oropharynx
benign.  Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Jugulovenous pressure is at 7 cm.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the right
sternal border with radiation to the neck.  Respiratory is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities warm, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Small
petechiae, left third digit and left great toe.
Neurological, alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves
2 through 12 grossly intact, nonfocal examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of admission
revealed white count 15.8, hematocrit 36.8, platelets 31,000.
INR 1.2, PTT 36.7.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 108,
carbon dioxide 22, BUN 43, creatinine 1.0, glucose 81.  Blood
from outside hospital on [**3-21**], 2 of 2 bottles of
Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, on [**3-22**], 2
of 2 bottles with gram positive cocci in clusters resembling
Staphylococcus as a preliminary report, [**3-23**], 4 of 4
bottles pending, urine from [**3-21**], Methicillin-susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following admission the patient was seen by
Infectious Disease as well as Electrophysiology.  Repeat
transesophageal echocardiogram was done which showed a 5.5 cm
mass on the pacer wire, likely not suitable for a
transcutaneous extraction following identification of this
mass Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted and the patient was
evaluated for open removal of his permanent pacing wires.  He
was accepted by Cardiothoracic Surgery and on [**3-28**], he
was brought to the Operating Room at which time he underwent
pacer wire extraction via sternotomy.  Please see the
operation report for full details.  The patient tolerated the
surgery well and was transferred from the Operating Room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He did well in the
immediate postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.
He remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
throughout postoperative day #1 as he required Neosynephrine
infusion to maintain an adequate blood pressure.  Throughout
postoperative day #1 and in the morning of postoperative day
#2 the patient was weaned from his Neosynephrine infusion and
on the morning of postoperative day #2 he was transferred
from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to Far 6 for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation. On
postoperative day #3 the patient was noted to have a period
of confusion and incoherent speech, however, his neurological
examination was nonfocal in nature.  Given the nature of the
patient's recently cardiac surgery as well as his vegetation
that was on his pacing wires the patient was brought for a
head computerized axial tomography scan to rule out an
embolic event.  The computerized axial tomography scan was
negative and the confusion was felt to be related to hospital
psychosis versus infection.  On chest x-ray the patient had a
right upper lobe infiltrate and therefore his intravenous
antibiotic coverage was expanded to include not only
Oxacillin but also Ceftazidime and Flagyl.  On postoperative
day #4 the patient's neurological status was noted to be
improved, however, at that time a new truncal rash was noted.
The rash was felt to be a result of his intravenous
antibiotic.  Because the patient had Oxacillin sensitive
Staphylococcus infection his Oxacillin was continued and his
Ceftazidime and Flagyl were discontinued.  The patient's rash
continued to be a problem extending not only to his trunk but
also to his upper extremities.  Dermatology was consulted and
they agreed that it was most likely a drug rash due to the
Oxacillin and therefore his Oxacillin was changed to
Vancomycin.  For the next several days the patient continued
to show slow progress and he remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable and remained on his intravenous
Vancomycin and on postoperative day #8 a PICC line was placed
for longterm intravenous antibiotic use.  On postoperative
day #9 it was felt that the patient was stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care
and rehabilitation.  At that time he was screened by several
rehabilitation centers.  It was expected that he will be
ready and accepted for discharge within the next several
days.  At this time the patient's condition is stable.  His
physical examination as of this time is vital signs with
temperature 98, heartrate 74 sinus rhythm, blood pressure
107/60, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturations 90%, on
40% shuttle.  Weight preoperatively is 82.3 kg.  At discharge
is 79.9 kg.

Laboratory data revealed white count 14.7, hematocrit 25.8,
platelets 222, PT 13.3, PTT 34.1, INR 1.2.  Sodium 135,
potassium 4.6, chloride 104, carbon dioxide 24, BUN 24,
creatinine 1.5, glucose 136.

Physical examination is alert and oriented times three.
Moves all extremities, follows all commands.  He can be
confused at times but easily reoriented. Respiratory, coarse
rhonchi throughout.  Breathsounds diminished bilaterally at
the bases, left greater than right. Strong productive cough.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Sternum
is stable.  Incision with steri-strips, open to air, clean
and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 1 to 2+ pedal edema.  He has a generalized rash
to the trunk, arms and legs that is resolving.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 19.7,
hematocrit 32.2, platelets 173,000, MCV 84, MCH 27,
neutrophils 79%, bands 4.0, lymphs 13, monos 3.  Sodium 131,
potassium 3.8, chloride 85, bicarbonate 28, BUN 105,
creatinine 5.2, blood sugar 117.  Anion gap 18, CK 132 and
130, CK/MB 2.0 and 2.0, troponin less than 0.3 and less than
0.3.  Urinalysis: yellow, no blood, nitrates, glucose,
ketones, bilirubin, no red blood cells or bacteria.  Blood
cultures times two are pending, urine culture pending.

Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary lines and is a limited
study due to body habitus.  Electrocardiogram shows a normal
sinus rhythm at 100 with a right atrial dilation, inverted
T-waves in II and AVF.

ASSESSMENT:  A 46 -year-old with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, cor pulmonale,
who presents with increased lower extremity pain and swelling
times three days with intermittent chest pain and worsening
cough.

PLAN:
1.  Infectious Disease:  The patient with ulceration on left
lower ankle, gets dressings every other day, green discharge,
consider pseudomonal infection, consider infection with
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, anaerobes.  The patient has
erythema on thigh and swelling of possible cellulitis.  The
patient is afebrile without fever or chills.  White blood
cell count is elevated at 19.7 with 4 bands.  The patient is
going to receive Ancef and ceftriaxone in the Emergency
Department.

Antibiotics on the floor were changed to Levaquin for gram
positive and Pseudomonas coverage and Flagyl to cover the
anaerobes.  The patient will be re-cultured if a temperature
spike.  The patient will give a sputum culture, wound will be
swabbed for culture.  Dressing changes twice a day with
Bacitracin to the ankle, erythromycin ointment for the eyes
for possible conjunctivitis.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient will have Dopplers bilaterally to
rule out deep vein thrombosis.  The patient has a cough with
sputum production for one month.  The patient has chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease that requires three liters of
oxygen and obstructive sleep apnea that requires CPAP.  The
patient will received chest physical therapy, Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers, CPAP, sputum culture.

3.  Cardiac:  The patient with vague chest pain, lasting
minutes, not radiating, not associated with exertion.  The
patient has inverted T-waves in leads III and AVF, rule out
myocardial infarction with CK/MBs times three and troponin.
The patient given aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin.  The
patient is preload dependent, so we will avoid medicines that
decrease preload.

4.  Renal:  The patient has chronic renal failure, now with
an acute increase in creatinine, may be prerenal state
secondary to overdiuresis.  The patient is also complaining
that he is concerned with decreased urine output.  The
patient's urine osmolality, creatinine, sodium, urea will be
rechecked.  The patient will get a Foley catheter, strict
intakes and outputs, and weights, will follow his BUN and
creatinine.  Renal dose of Levaquin will be 250 mg po q day,
will hold Lasix for now.

5.  Pain control:  The patient has increased pain in the
lower extremities, so we will give him Percocet and Tylenol.

6.  Dermatology:  We will continue the patient's regimen for
his elephantiasis of his lower extremities, using Nystatin
cream, miconazole lotion.

7.  Hypertension:  Continue hydralazine 100 mg qid, continue
clonidine 0.3 mg q day, Isordil 40 mg tid, hold Diltiazem.
The patient needs decreased afterload, but is preload
dependent.

8.  Mental status:  The patient is disoriented.  We will
follow his mental status to determine if this is his baseline
or if another process is occurring.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonology:  During this hospital course, the patient
stabilized with a nonproductive cough.  The patient was
requiring CPAP at night, O2 dependence for his chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with saturations from 85% on
five liters and 76% on room air during the night of [**2139-9-1**].
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for O2 saturations as low as 70% on five liters.  The
patient noted to be slightly disoriented and tremulous.
Arterial blood gases were sent, noting a pH of 7.2, CO2 of
91, and oxygen of 90.  A chest x-ray was done.  He was given
one dose of Lasix IV 80 mg.  He was also given nitroglycerin
paste and placed on BiPAP.  A repeat arterial blood gas was
taken at the time and was pH of 7.27, CO2 of 70, and an O2 of
39.

At that time the patient became hypoxic and required
ventilatory support.  The patient was then on [**2139-9-2**]
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit while on the
ventilator.  The patient stayed on the ventilator up until
[**2139-9-15**], when at that time due to failure to weaning off the
ventilator, the decision was made by the physicians and
patient as well as patient's wife, that a permanent or
semi-permanent tracheostomy would be performed with a
tracheostomy tube in place.  A tracheostomy tube was placed
and the patient has been on ventilatory support through his
tracheostomy tube, doing well.

The patient, on discharge, was able to be on pressure support
of 20, PEEP of 10, oxygen pressure of 40%, respirations at
10, breathing on his own with tidal volume 700-900 with over
a liter during large breaths.  The patient's arterial blood
gas before discharge with a pH of 7.4, CO2 of 44, oxygen
saturation of 116%.  The patient doing well, voice seems to
be coming back, able to communicate somewhat, able to answer
questions with yes or no by moving his head.  The patient is
much more alert and tolerating breathing on his own overnight
as well, not requiring any mandatory breaths or IMV.

The patient had a bleeding issue when the tracheostomy tube
was placed.  The patient did received DDAVP for uremic
platelets during this increased BUN and creatinine, renal
insufficiency.  The bleeding did stop and the patient is not
bleeding currently from the tracheostomy site.  Of note, the
patient did have oozing and some bleeding from the Quinton
site for his hemodialysis.  That site was changed and a
slight hematoma developed at the site of the new left Quinton
catheter.  The patient currently has an O2 saturation of 100%
on the current ventilator settings that he will be discharged
on.  Pressure support of 20, PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  The patient has known right heart issues with
tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  An
electrocardiogram was done which showed, on [**2139-8-31**], mildly
dilated atrium, a mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
of the left ventricle is normal, overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal.  Septal flattening and
paradoxical septal motion.  Right ventricle is markedly
dilated, severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis, moderate to severe 3+ tricuspid regurgitation,
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient did have some episodes of hypotension during his
hospital course and requiring a Dopamine IV drip.  The
patient currently has a blood pressure of 125/66.  Dopamine
drip was stopped and the patient's normal cardiac medicines
were restarted, such as hydralazine and clonidine and
Isordil.  The patient's chest x-ray showed possible
congestive heart failure, with a portable chest x-ray
compared to a previous one done on [**2139-8-28**] showing heart
appears to be enlarged, pulmonary vascularity appears
engorged and slightly indistinct, elevation of right
hemidiaphragm.  The patient had a LENI on [**2139-8-30**] which
showed no deep vein thrombosis, but was a limited study.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had a Quinton catheter,
a triple lumen subclavian, and a PICC line, all replaced due
to line infection which started with a low grade temperature
on [**2139-9-9**] and increased white blood cell count.  The
patient was put on vancomycin with dosing levels for renal
insufficiency.  Sensitivities eventually showed the catheter
tips grew Enterococci that were sensitive to ampicillin.  The
patient was changed to ampicillin at this time, renally
dosed.  The patient is presently on day four of a fourteen
day regimen of ampicillin.

The patient was also started on erythromycin ointment for a
conjunctivitis.  Conjunctivitis has since cleared, but
continues to have conjunctival hemorrhage.  The patient did
receive a ten day course of Levaquin for a leg ulcer.  The
patient has been afebrile recently.  The patient's ulcer swab
grew Pseudomonas which was pansensitive.  Blood cultures
recently showed no growth.  Sputum cultures showed sparse
oropharyngeal growth.

4.  Renal status:  He has acute on chronic renal failure,
etiology is unclear.  The patient had a Foley placed.  Urine
output did increase.  The patient receiving three times a
week hemodialysis.  Creatinine on discharge is 3.1, close to
baseline for this patient with a BUN of 90 and a potassium of
4.2.  The patient did receive IV fluids and now is able to
tolerate tube feeds and the patient did receive three days of
total parenteral nutrition while waiting for tube feeds.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient's gastrointestinal
situation has cleared.  The patient was ruled out for an
obstruction with a KUB.  The patient was given po
erythromycin and various bowel regimens to stimulate the
gastrointestinal tract.  The patient had three large bowel
movements over the past three days and is now tolerating tube
feeds and moving his bowels appropriately.

6.  Hematology:  The patient's coagulopathy seems to have
cleared.  The patient's bleeding and oozing at tracheostomy
site and lines have stopped, although there is a small
hematoma at the site of the Quinton catheter.  The patient
was also given vitamin K during these episodes.  The patient
continues to have a slight anemia with a hematocrit of 28.3.
The patient was transfused during his hospital stay with four
units of packed red blood cells.  The patient's ferritin and
iron studies showed that he was consistent with anemia of
chronic disease.  The patient is receiving Epogen three times
a week.

7.  Dermatology:  The patient's dermatological issues are
being covered with ointments applied to the elephantiasis due
to chronic lymphatic obstruction.  The patient receives cloth
wraps for his lower extremities which seem to help with the
lymphatic stasis and elephantiasis.  The patient did receive
a bronchoscopy during his hospital stay for issues of
bleeding from the tracheostomy site.  The patient was found
to have good airways and any blood in the airway was
suctioned and no active bleeding was found.

8.  Neurology:  The patient's neurologic status is improved.
The patient is status post sedation for the intubation.  He
is now clearing.  The patient is able to answer questions, is
attempting to speak with some limited use of his voice.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to a facility
that can accommodate his ventilation requirements, most
likely [**Hospital1 **] in [**Hospital1 8**] or Olympus Specialty in
[**Location (un) 38**].  The patient's wife is aware of his situation.
The patient is a full code.  The patient will be discharged
with his tracheostomy tube and Quinton line for potential
hemodialysis at the rehabilitation center.  The patient will
be attempted to be weaned off the ventilator with probable
needs at night for his obstructive sleep apnea.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Renal insufficiency.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with possible
congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable, on oxygen at night with the need
for hemodialysis in the future.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Includes hydralazine 100 mg qid,
Lasix, Diltiazem 180 mg each day, clonidine 3.0 mg q day,
KCL, Atrovent nebulizers, Isordil 40 mg three times a day,
miconazole, Maalox, Tylenol, Nystatin powder, Usaryl.

JOB#:  [**Job Number **]


Admission Date:  [**2139-8-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-10-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2093-5-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

ADDENDUM:  Since the last discharge summary, dictated on
[**2139-9-21**], there have been additional events during
this [**Hospital 228**] hospital course:

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient has been requiring less
ventilator support.  He was weaned down to ventilator
settings of pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 5 with 30%
FiO2, and was doing well on those settings.  Therefore, he
has been allowed to come off the ventilator for trial with
50% tracheostomy mask.  These trials should be no longer than
12 hours during the day, as the patient will begin to retain
carbon dioxide if left off of the ventilator for longer than
that.  He clinically does not become severely tachypneic,
however, in a recent trial, the patient was off of the
ventilator for over 24 hours and arterial blood gases
subsequently showed a pH of 7.15, pCO2 of 75 and pO2 of 60.
He also tolerates a Passe Muir valve well.  He has
significant secretions but he is able to clear them on his
own and suction them on his own with the Yankauer suction.
His oxygen saturations on the ventilator range from 93% to
98% and, when off the ventilator, range from the upper 80s to
low 90s.  The most recent ventilator settings which the
patient was rested on were a C-PAP and pressure support of 10
with 5 of PEEP at an FiO2 of 0.5.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient is hemodynamically stable
and continues on Isordil, hydralazine and clonidine for blood
pressure control.  At the time of discharge, he is becoming
more hypertensive, with blood pressures up to 170 systolic.
If further blood pressure control is necessary, a calcium
channel blocker should be considered to be added to the
regimen, as this is what the patient was on previously as an
outpatient, and a beta blocker was tried while admitted at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and resulted in the
patient with a subjective feeling of shortness of breath.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient, as stated in the
previous discharge summary, had been found to have
Enterococcal bacteremia, for which he was on ampicillin twice
a day.  He subsequently grew Enterococcus out of both new
line and a peripheral site.  He had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which revealed no evidence of endocarditis.
This was discussed with cardiology and infectious disease as
to whether the patient required a transesophageal
echocardiogram in order to definitively rule out
endocarditis.  It was decided that the patient had adequate
windows on the transthoracic echocardiogram and, as long as
subsequent blood cultures remained negative, it could
concluded that the patient did not have endocarditis.
Therefore, the patient's ampicillin dose was increased to 1
gram every six hours and surveillance blood cultures were
drawn repeatedly after the increased ampicillin dose.  All of
those cultures remained negative and the patient is to
receive his last dose of ampicillin at 6:00 p.m. on the day
of discharge.

The patient also grew Stenotrophomonas, which was drawn off
of his arterial line.  This line was pulled and he was
treated with Bactrim for a ten day course, and no further
blood cultures have grown Stenotrophomonas.  Finally, the
patient developed a vesicular rash on his left chest in a
dermatomal distribution around to his back, and dermatology
was consulted for this.  It was felt to be herpes zoster,
which was confirmed by culture.  He is currently on day six
of a ten day course with acyclovir, renally dosed, in order
to treat this.

4.  Renal:  The patient continues on hemodialysis three times
a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.  He had a
Perm-A-Cath placed on the right on [**2139-10-2**] after all
blood cultures had been negative from Enterococcus.  His
baseline creatinine is in the 3s on hemodialysis.  He does
not have problems with hyperkalemia.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient suffered an upper
gastrointestinal bleed on [**2139-9-30**].  On that day, he
was incontinence of loose black/brown stool overnight, which
were occult blood positive.  Nasogastric lavage was
performed, which was occult blood positive.  His hematocrit
went from 24.8 down to 21.4 with the bleed.  Gastroenterology
was consulted and an upper endoscopy was performed, which
found grade II esophagitis in the lower third of the
esophagus, an ulcer in the distal body of the stomach,
erythema, erosion and friability in the antrum, fundus and
cardia compatible with gastritis, and erythema, friability
and erosion in the duodenum compatible with duodenitis.  The
patient was eventually transfused with eight units of packed
red blood cells and he was placed on increased Protonix of 40
mg twice a day for three days, and he was evaluated for
Helicobacter pylori, which came back negative.  At the time
of discharge, the patient is back on a Protonix dose of 40 mg
daily and he is tolerating orals of soft solids without any
further evidence of bleeding.

6.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit has been stable in
the upper 20s since receiving his transfusion.  He continues
to receive Epogen three times per week as well.

7.  Dermatology:  Again, the patient was found to have herpes
zoster, for which he is currently in the middle of a ten day
course of acyclovir.  He also receives Domeboro solution
soaks to the zoster lesions twice a day for pruritus.  His
elephantiasis is improving on the Estar gel and the Hibiclens
soaks, and the Lotrimin cream, the doses of which are
outlined in the medication section of the discharge summary.

8.  Neurology:  The patient has left upper extremity weakness
which continues.  He was evaluated by neurology for this, and
it is felt that the patient most likely has nerve compression
secondary to a hematoma which formed after his tracheostomy
was placed.  The hematoma is slowly resolving.  The patient
could not be adequately imaged in order to evaluate this more
thoroughly due to his size.  Some plain films of the neck
were attempted to rule out any bony involvement which could
be contributing to compression, however, they also were of
suboptimal quality because of the patient's size.  The
recommendation of the neurology team at the time of discharge
is that the patient should receive an EMG one month after
discharge in order to assess ultimate prognosis.  He also can
follow up in the [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Country **] neurology clinic after the EMG
is performed.  The telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44**].  In
addition, once the patient is able to tolerate it, if
possible, he should get a neck and brachial plexus CT scan in
a facility which can accommodate weights greater than 350
pounds.  Finally, his pain should continue to be adequately
treated.  At the time of discharge, he is receiving Tylenol
#3 as needed.

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Pending):


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was treated on medical service with IVF for ARF, to
which he responded well with BUN/Creatinine dropping. Several
days after admission he became increasingly febrile and acutely
uncomfortable in the rectal area (WBC increased to 20). Surgery
was consulted and patient was transferred to the surgery service
for incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess (6/23+[**6-10**]).
Cultures from the wound initially grew out enterococcus and
anaerobes, and the wound was negative for MRSA. Several sets of
blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with 10
days of antibiotics, initially levo/vanco and metronidazole,
although treatment was tailored based on repeat cultures. He is
no longer on antibiotics, has been afebrile and wound looks
good. Since drainage, the wound is open, and has been packed
several times/day. THe patient also [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 60594**] [**Last Name (un) **] baths tid.
This care will need to continue until the would granulates,
heals over and closes on its own- something we anticipate will
take time. When he stools the wound needs to be cleaned
(irrigated with NS and repacked with clean gauze).
While the abscess was the main reason for the patient's
admission, several other issues required management while he was
in the hospital. He is IDDM, and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for better
glucose control. Their recommendations will be included in the
discharge instructions and medication lists.
In addition, the patient experienced several episodes of chest
pain, sob. Cardiology was consulted and he was cleared. He ruled
out for MI several times and EKGs showed no acute change. He
remained on telemetry due to his cardiac history the entire
admission, and is known to experience PVCs, sometimes as many as
[**10-4**], while being asymptomatic. This was felt to be
unconcerning to cardiology, unless they occurr in runs similar
to Vtac, at which point (or at any point the patient is
symptomatic) cardiac enzymes should be sent. He has a history of
CHF and his sob was felt to be mostly due to fluid overload
while in the hosptital. At discharge he is felt to be nearly
back to baseline fluid-wise,although he still has significant
atelectasis and an unclear h/o asthma/COPD for which he requires
frequent nebulizer treatment. He needs aggressive chest PT and
to be up and out of bed often as well as a clear eye on making
sure that he does not become fluid overloaded.
In general, He is eating a regular diet and tolerating it well,
and has not needed IVF for over a week. He is usually alert and
oriented, however can become confused at night. We have found
that trazodone qhs is very helpful rather than haldol or some
other sort of sedative. He is an endearing man who unfortunately
will require considerable help keeping his abscess area clean
and un-infected, and we hope that you will be able to help him
as best you can. Thank you.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following intubation, the patient became hypotensive; he
required treatment with pressors after IV fluids failed to raise
his BP.  He received solumedrol as a treatment for COPD
exacerbation.  He was started on a course of levofloxacin,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin for presumed septic shock.  A head
CT was negative.  Also, he ruled out for both an MI and PE.  His
variable blood glucose was managed with an insulin drip, and his
mental status improved.
The patient??????s chest CT scan showed RUL and LLL consolidation
consistent with infection.  Also, a rounded density was present
anterior to the anterior
segmental branch of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery,
representing
either an area of atelectasis/consolidation or a mass lesion.
(Follow up chest CT is recommended.)  He was switched to
antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn for a possible
aspiration PNA on [**12-13**].  His sputum, urine, and sacral wounds
were all cultured, with the following results:
[**12-13**] Blood cx: diptheroids [**1-19**]; Staph coag negative [**2-19**].
[**12-14**] U cx contaminated; sputum gram-stain consistent with oral
flora, cxgrows rare yeast and negative for Legionella; wound
swabs rare growth of GNRs, diptheroids, Pseudomonas, both coag
positive and negative Staph, probable enterococcus, Proteus.
He was extubated on [**12-16**] and transferred to the medicine
service.
The patient had a mild tremor while in the ICU and was seen by
neurology when he reached the medicine service, who diagnosed
him with a physiologic, non-Parkinsonian tremor most likely
secondary to albuterol or steroids.  The patient was also seen
by a speech and swallow consult, who cleared him for a full
diet.
The patient was weaned off his oxygen requirement over 3 days
without difficulty.  His IV antibiotics were transitioned to PO
levofloxacin, and he continued a steroid taper for his COPD
exacerbation.  Of note, the patient's HCT was noted to range
between 24 and 27 on the floor, a marked decrease from 42 on
admission.  His stools were guiac negative, and iron studies
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  He had no clear
source for any bleeding.  The patient received 1U of blood the
day before discharge and had a stable HCT at 27 on the day of
discharge.
Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's sacral ulcers were
followed by plastic surgery.  The patient will follow up with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery as an outpatient.  Of note, a blood
cx from [**12-17**] is still PND.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old man with AVR/Asc Aorta Replacement and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
INDICATION: Status post AVR and ascending aorta replacement with
chest tube removal. Rule out pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: [**2169-4-3**].

SINGLE SEMI UPRIGHT AP BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: All invasive
lines and tubes have been removed including right-sided chest
tube. No evidence of pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low and
retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis in this
postoperative patient, though consolidation is also a
possibility. Moderate left pleural effusion is new. Cardiac,
mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. The patient is
status post median sternotomy.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax after chest tube
removal. Moderate left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity
(likely atelectasis in this postoperative patient) are new
compared to [**2169-4-3**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Synthroid 88 mcg p.o. q.d.
2. Megace 800 IU qd.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital 9013**], not ambulatory and is a Full Code Status.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologic - The patient was
responsive with pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
He has baseline mental retardation and only responsive to
verbal stimuli, noncommunicative.  Cardiovascular examination
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  Pulmonary
examination clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell 5.0,
hemoglobin 11.9, hematocrit 35.4, platelets 223,000.  Sodium
137, potassium 3.7, chloride 109, bicarbonate 18, blood urea
nitrogen 19, creatinine 0.9, glucose 107, calcium 7.2,
phosphorus 1.9, magnesium 2.8.  Prothrombin time 14.6,
partial thromboplastin time 35.9, INR 1.4.  The patient
underwent cortisol stimulation test.  Baseline after thirty
minutes 7.8, after sixty minutes equal 9.2.  Blood cultures
to date on admission to medicine floor was no growth.  Urine
culture was no growth.  Sputum culture was positive for
coagulase positive staphylococcus and 1+ budding yeast.
Chest x-ray showed positive right sided lower lobe opacity.
Stool was C. difficile negative.  Yersinia negative.  Vibrio
negative.  Electroencephalographic results were pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2102-7-27**], with hypotension and
hypoxia.  He was started on Levaquin for community acquired
pneumonia and Flagyl for aspiration coverage and anaerobic
coverage and Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus coverage as he was seen as a high risk
patient because he was transferred from a nursing home.

The patient was also on Dopamine for decreased blood pressure
in the unit. This persisted as episodic hypotension despite
dopamine and improvement in his pneumonia.  He was seen by
cardiology while in the unit.
Cardiology felt the etiology of his low blood pressure was
likely secondary to sepsis given his heart was structurally
normal on ECHO obtained in the hospital.

The patient was also evaluated for adrenal insufficiency
while in the unit and he was found to have secondary adrenal
insufficiency.  The patient had been on Megace while at the
nursing home which had been stopped on admission to the hosptial,
and this was thought to be the cause of his
secondary adrenal insufficiency.  He was started on
Hydrocortisone.

The patient was extubated on [**2102-8-2**], and was weaned off his
Dopamine on [**2102-8-3**]. He was treated with the intravenous
antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and positive Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus culture and was transferred
to the medicine team on [**2102-8-4**].

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient also
had a few asystolic events (longest 10 sec) with atrial pauses
which resolved
on their own.  Cardiology felt that he requires a pacemaker
and the patient was scheduled to have pacemaker placement on
Monday, [**2102-8-6**], however, while awaiting pacemaker on the
medicine floor, the patient again spiked fever and had an
increase in his white count around [**2102-8-5**].  The patient's
central line was taken out.  Cultures were sent.  Foley was
taken out and his procedure was postponed.  The patient
remained on intravenous Vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl.

His cultures came back from his central line catheter tip
positive for
Staphylococcus aureus coagulase negative.  Vancomycin was
discontinued and switched to Oxacillin given sensitivity of
Staphylococcus aureus to Oxacillin.  The patient remained
afebrile from [**2102-8-7**], to [**2102-8-11**], and the patient
continued intravenous antibiotics, Vancomycin, Flagyl,
Levaquin and switched from Vancomycin to Oxacillin on
[**2102-8-11**].

The patient while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
initially when on the medical floor was kept NPO for
aspiration precautions.  The patient was evaluated by Speech
and Swallow and was recommended thick pureed honey like
liquid diet.  Family discussed options including possibility
of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement and felt
that continuing feeds as tolerated by the patient and if he
reached adequate calorie count would be the feeding method of
choice.  He remained tolerant of p.o. intake and will
continue thick liquid honey like diet.

In terms of his secondary adrenal insufficiency which was
diagnosed by the cortisol stimulation test, the patient was
initially on Hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenous t.i.d. and was
changed to 50 mg intravenous b.i.d. while on the medical
floor and will be discharged on Prednisone taper p.o.
starting at 20 mg.

Renally, the patient had no issues.  Prophylactically, the
patient was given subcutaneous Heparin, Protonix.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Aspiration pneumonia.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flagyl intravenous 500 mg q8hours.
2.  Oxacillin 2 mg intravenous q6hours.
3.  Levaquin 500 mg intravenous q24hours.
4.  Nystatin p.r.n.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Heparin 5900 units subcutaneous b.i.d.
7.  Synthroid 88 mcg q.d.
8.  Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with primary care
physician upon discharge and will remain on oxacillin for a
total of
two weeks following which blood cultures will be repeated.
If negative, the patient will return for pacemaker placement
by Electrophysiology.
