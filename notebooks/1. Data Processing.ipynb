For the\\npast six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous\\nexercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually\\nresolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with\\nwalking. She does acknowledge that there is associated\\nnausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she\\nstarted to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.\\nShe was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,\\nwhere she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was\\nreferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which\\nrevealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to\\nher transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and\\nback pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip\\nwas started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of\\nIV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the\\ncath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now\\nshe is not actively complaining of any pain.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity\\nedema, but she does acknowledge that she does have\\ndysmenorrhea.\\n\\nPRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,\\ndiagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet\\nsince [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has\\nlost 40 pounds in the last six months.\\n\\nSHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,\\nlisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg\\nonce a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,\\nAtivan.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol\\nand she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.\\nHer brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial\\ninfarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She\\ndoes have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,\\nin no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse\\n72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.\\nHead and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes\\nmoist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:\\nRegular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation\\nbilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but\\nshe is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities\\nare warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all\\nextremities.\\n\\nHer laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were\\nwhite count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.\\nHemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,\\nchloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total\\ncholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.\\n\\n[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at\\n[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior\\ndescending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;\\n50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;\\nmoderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection\\nfraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right\\ncoronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than\\nwhat was actually reported on the initial catheterization\\nresults from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be\\n80% as previously reported.\\n\\nSo this was a woman who was considered to have unstable\\nangina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an\\nintraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,\\nand was \"preoped\" and consented for a CABG on the next day\\nbecause of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.\\nafter midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the\\noperating room.\\n\\nOn[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the\\noperating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.\\nPlease refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.\\n[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,\\nthree grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to\\nthe left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous\\nvein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on\\ncardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross\\nclamped for 53 of those minutes.\\n\\nShe tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the\\nintensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.\\n\\nPostoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her\\nintraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips\\nwere discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative\\nday two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she\\nwas transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues\\nwere as follows.\\n\\nMs. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared\\nher to go home with home physical therapy to assist with\\nmobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively\\ndiuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted\\naccordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia\\nwhile she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation\\nwas obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a\\nday to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an\\noutpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup\\nappointment.\\n\\nOn [**1-14**] the patient\\'s central line was discontinued.\\nShe was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;\\nhowever, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to\\nbe more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and\\nan EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this\\nchest pain.\\n\\nShe is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,\\nbeing discharged home in good condition with home physical\\ntherapy scheduled.\\n\\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\\n1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\\n2.  Hypertension.\\n3.  Obesity.\\n4.  Hyperlipidemia.\\n5.  Unstable angina.\\n6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post\\ncoronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic\\nballoon pump.\\n7.  Hypokalemia.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.\\n2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.\\n4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\n5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.\\n6.

The aortic valve leaflets are\\nmoderately\\nthickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8\\ncm2) The mitral\\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\\nprolapse. Mild\\n(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets\\nare mildly\\nthickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic\\nhypertension. There is\\nno pericardial effusion.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old man with COPD, DM 2, HTN, admitted\\nfor unresponsivenes, found to have profound anemia of 14.8, with\\nreport of dark tarry stool in ED. He was initially intubated for\\ncolonoscopy/EGD, and could not be extubated afterward. His brief\\nICU course, by problem:\\n.\\n#) Anemia: Baseline hct in high 30's, 14.8 on admission.\\nEGD/colonoscopy unrevealing.  Per GI, capsule likely not\\nindicated, patient's behavioral issues may prevent him from\\ncooperating with capsule study requirements. No evidence of\\nactive GI bleed or ischemia, thus lower threshold for\\ntransfusion.\\n.\\n#) Respiratory failure: Initially failed extubation secondary to\\npresumed VAP. On [**11-18**], he began to have thick green secretions\\nand RR > 30 with fever to 101.8; concern for VAP, placed on\\nvancomycin and cefepime.  Chest xray showed evidence of\\nCHF/volume overload.  ECHO showed MR, AS, diastolic\\nfailure--likely all contributing as well. Currently growing GNR\\nin sputum for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia\\n.\\n#) Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Baseline hct in high 30's, 14.8 on\\nadmission. Per GI, capsule likely not indicated, patient's\\nbehavioral issues may prevent him from cooperating with capsule\\nstudy requirements. No evidence of active GI bleed or ischemia,\\nthus lower threshold for transfusion.\\n.\\n#) Thrombocytopenia:  Resolved. Multiple possible etiologies\\nconsidered, including HIT (HIT antibodies negative), drug\\neffect. Platelets 179 on [**11-22**].\\n.\\n#) NSTEMI: most likely due to demand ischemia in setting of\\nprofound anemia. Pt has HTN, and now evidence of moderate AS on\\nTTE.  Cardiology aware and recommended transfusing to Hct > 30;\\nwill consider BB once hemodynamically stable.\\n- Restart ASA and heparin in setting of GIB\\n- Attempt re-start low-dose beta-blocker today\\n- continue statin\\n.\\n#) Mental status change:  Pt currently intubated and sedated.\\nMental status changes likely multifactorial in setting of\\nanemia, NSTEMI, OSA, hyperglycemia, and hypercarbia in patient\\nwith underlying dementia and schizoaffective d/o.  Per\\nhealthcare proxy, at baseline patient usually more quiet and\\nless agitated/ aggressive, but has periods of\\nagitation/aggression. Resolved over several days post discharge\\nfrom the ICU.\\n.\\n#) DM 2: pt on insulin 70/30 [**Hospital1 **] at rehab, here was on [**12-27**] dose\\nuntil [**11-21**] when 2 more units AM and PM were added.

The patient was noted to be hypoxic\\nduring sleep at the nursing home. Upon observation in ICU he has\\nwitnessed apneas that correlate with [**Month/Day/Year **].  Chest CTA shows\\nno evidence of pneumonia or PE.  There is mild CHF but would not\\naccount for acute desaturations. Sleep apnea was thought to be a\\nprimary factor in the recurrent episodes of [**Month/Day/Year **] at night.He\\nwas started on noninvasive ventilation during sleep. However the\\npatient was not cooperative and very agitated at times and\\nneeded to be restrained medically and physically to tolerate\\nBIPAP. The problem of the patients inability to cooperate with\\nmedications and BIPAP use and the possible dangers to his health\\nincluding hypoventilation and death were discussed with the\\npatient's sister.  A sleep consult was obtained to help with the\\npatients management. Haldol 5mg at night was attempted as a\\nstrategy to minize agitation at night and facilitate compliance\\nwith BiPAP.\\n    The option of definitive tracheostomy was discussed with the\\nMICU Pulmonologists. Howevever, it was determined that the risks\\nof treatment would outweigh the benefits of the procedure, given\\nthe risk of self-decannulation during an episode of agitation.\\nThe ongoing risk of [**Month/Day/Year **] was discussed with the patient and\\nwith his sister and that there was no medical treatment that\\ncould eradicate this risk.\\n..\\n2) CHF/Aortic stenosis:\\nPer Echo [**2185-11-16**]: [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 gradient 34. EF 70-80% Mild pulm\\nedema on CXR and chest CT. The patient was mildly overloaded on\\nadmission and was diuresed initially. He was then started on\\ndaily Lasix to maintain euvolemia. Lisinopril was continued and\\nuptitrated.\\n..\\n3) CAD:\\nOn admission, had mild cardiac enzyme elevation c/w demand\\nischemia.  Aspirin was avoided due to a recent severe GIB.\\nContinued lipitor.\\n..\\n4) BACTERURIA:  U/A equivocal with neg nitrite, LE and pyuria,\\nbacteruria.  As pt has no other signs of infection, and culture\\nwas negative, antibiotics were not given.\\n..\\n5) DM2:  Avandia and glucophage were withheld initially.  Outpt\\ninsulin regimen was continued. Subsequently as component of CHF\\nwas improving, Avandia and glucophage were restarted.\\n..\\n6) NEURO/PSYCH:\\nPt has dementia and SAD.  Hypercarbia may have accounted\\npartially for his mental status changes as well.  [**Location (un) **] may\\nhave contributed.  The patient was intermittently very agitated\\nand aggressive and required four point restraints and 1:1\\nsitter. Psychiatry was consulted and helped with management.\\nHaldol was given standing and prn in acute agitation. The\\npatient became more cooperative. Once the acute medical issues\\nhad resolved, the Haldol was decreased to 5mg PO qhs, and the\\nprn Haldol was hardly used on the floor. EEG was performed to\\nrule out seizures as a possible cause of the episodes of\\nlethargy which were being attributed to non-compliance with\\nCPAP. The EEG showed only diffuse slowing.\\n..\\n7) h/o severe GI bleed:\\nOn a prior admission, the pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]\\n[**2185-11-14**] with a severe GI bleed and found to have hct of 14 and\\nhe was unresponsive. EGC and colonoscopy were unrevealing. This\\nremained an inactive issue during this admission and the pt\\nrequired no transfusions, though continued to have a hct in the\\n27 range\\n.\\n8) Syphilis:\\nRPR was positive. He was initially empirically treated.\\nPencillin was started on [**12-9**] and stopped on [**12-13**] when\\nconfirmatory tests came back negative.\\n.\\n9.
